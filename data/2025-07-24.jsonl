Here we consider a recent generalisation of\nthe definition of modularity to temporal graphs, whose edge-sets change over\ndiscrete timesteps; such graphs offer a more realistic model of many real-world\nnetworks in which connections between entities (for example, between\nindividuals in a social network) evolve over time. Computing modularity is\nnotoriously difficult: it is NP-hard even to approximate in general, and only\nadmits efficient exact algorithms in very restricted special cases. Our main\nresult is that a multiplicative approximation to temporal modularity can be\ncomputed efficiently when the underlying graph has small treewidth. This\ngeneralises a similar approximation algorithm for the static case, but requires\nsome substantially new ideas to overcome technical challenges associated with\nthe temporal nature of the problem."}

Its objective\nis to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent\nis defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.\nExplicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for\nbounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a\nuser-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and\na lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of\npaths whose SOC is at most $w \\cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve\ncollisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its\noptimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually\nbounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower\nbound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up\nEECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though\nEECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution,\nincreasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \\cdot LB$, forcing EECBS\nto switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a\nparticular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue,\nwe propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion\nto the number of collisions. We also estimate the delays needed to satisfy\nconstraints and propose Delay-Based Flex Distribution.

To ensure LLMs do not assist with\nharmful requests, safety alignment fine-tuning is necessary in the\npost-training phase. However, safety alignment fine-tuning has recently been\nshown to significantly degrade reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as the\n\"Safety Tax\". In this work, we show that using LoRA for SFT on refusal datasets\neffectively aligns the model for safety without harming its reasoning\ncapabilities. This is because restricting the safety weight updates to a\nlow-rank space minimizes the interference with the reasoning weights. Our\nextensive experiments across four benchmarks covering math, science, and coding\nshow that this approach produces highly safe LLMs -- with safety levels\ncomparable to full-model fine-tuning -- without compromising their reasoning\nabilities. Additionally, we observe that LoRA induces weight updates with\nsmaller overlap with the initial weights compared to full-model fine-tuning. We\nalso explore methods that further reduce such overlap -- via regularization or\nduring weight merging -- and observe some improvement on certain tasks. We hope\nthis result motivates designing approaches that yield more consistent\nimprovements in the reasoning-safety trade-off."}

Despite\nremarkable efforts by influential players in the global EV market, such as\nChina, the United States, and the European Union, the progress in EVCI rollout\nhas been notably slower than anticipated in the rest of the world.

As a promising sensitive data perturbation method, negative\nsurvey methods is able to complete the task of collecting sensitive information\ndistribution while protecting personal privacy.

To bridge this gap, this paper\nproposes a novel real-value negative survey model, termed RVNS, for the first\ntime in the field of real-value sensitive information collection. The RVNS\nmodel exempts users from the necessity of discretizing their data and only\nrequires them to sample a set of data from a range that deviates from their\nactual sensitive details, thereby preserving the privacy of their genuine\ninformation. Moreover, to accurately capture the distribution of sensitive\ninformation, an optimization problem is formulated, and a novel approach is\nemployed to solve it.

The 5G-AKA protocol, standardized\nby 3GPP in TS 33.501, is central to authentication in current 5G deployments.\nIt provides mutual authentication, user privacy, and key secrecy. However,\ndespite its adoption, 5G-AKA has known limitations in both security and\nperformance. While it focuses on protecting privacy against passive attackers,\nrecent studies show its vulnerabilities to active attacks. It also relies on a\nsequence number mechanism to prevent replay attacks, requiring perfect\nsynchronization between the device and the core network. This stateful design\nadds complexity, causes desynchronization, and incurs extra communication\noverhead.

To\nenable this, Corr-RR operates in two phases: (1) a subset of users apply\nstandard LDP mechanisms to estimate correlations, and (2) each remaining user\nperturbs one attribute and infers the others using the learned correlations.

To address this challenge, we propose\nTrustDefender, a two-stage framework comprising (i) a lightweight convolutional\nneural network (CNN) that detects deepfake imagery in real-time extended\nreality (XR) streams, and (ii) an integrated succinct zero-knowledge proof\n(ZKP) protocol that validates detection results without disclosing raw user\ndata. Our design addresses both the computational constraints of XR platforms\nwhile adhering to the stringent privacy requirements in sensitive settings.\nExperimental evaluations on multiple benchmark deepfake datasets demonstrate\nthat TrustDefender achieves 95.3% detection accuracy, coupled with efficient\nproof generation underpinned by rigorous cryptography, ensuring seamless\nintegration with high-performance artificial intelligence (AI) systems. By\nfusing advanced computer vision models with provable security mechanisms, our\nwork establishes a foundation for reliable AI in immersive and\nprivacy-sensitive applications."}

This study investigates how\nintegrating DTs with penetration testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs)\ncan enhance cybersecurity education and operational readiness. By simulating\nrealistic cyber environments, this approach offers a practical, interactive\nframework for exploring vulnerabilities and defensive strategies. At the core\nof this research is the Red Team Knife (RTK), a custom penetration testing\ntoolkit aligned with the Cyber Kill Chain model. RTK is designed to guide\nlearners through key phases of cyberattacks, including reconnaissance,\nexploitation, and response within a DT powered ecosystem. The incorporation of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) further enriches the experience by providing\nintelligent, real-time feedback, natural language threat explanations, and\nadaptive learning support during training exercises. This combined DT LLM\nframework is currently being piloted in academic settings to develop hands on\nskills in vulnerability assessment, threat detection, and security operations.\nInitial findings suggest that the integration significantly improves the\neffectiveness and relevance of cybersecurity training, bridging the gap between\ntheoretical knowledge and real-world application. Ultimately, the research\ndemonstrates how DTs and LLMs together can transform cybersecurity education to\nmeet evolving industry demands."}
