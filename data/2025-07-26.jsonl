Several approaches\nhave been proposed in the literature for detecting vulnerable codes and\nidentifying the classes of vulnerabilities. However, there is still room to\nwork in explaining the root causes of detected vulnerabilities through locating\nvulnerable statements and the discovery of paths leading to the activation of\nthe vulnerability. While frameworks like SliceLocator offer explanations by\nidentifying vulnerable paths, they rely on rule-based sink identification that\nlimits their generalization. In this paper, we introduce VulPathFinder, an\nexplainable vulnerability path discovery framework that enhances SliceLocator's\nmethodology by utilizing a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model for detecting\nsink statements, rather than relying on predefined rules. The proposed GNN\ncaptures semantic and syntactic dependencies to find potential sink points\n(PSPs), which are candidate statements where vulnerable paths end. After\ndetecting PSPs, program slicing can be used to extract potentially vulnerable\npaths, which are then ranked by feeding them back into the target graph-based\ndetector. Ultimately, the most probable path is returned, explaining the root\ncause of the detected vulnerability. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach by performing evaluations on a benchmark of the buffer\noverflow CWEs from the SARD dataset, providing explanations for the\ncorresponding detected vulnerabilities. The results show that VulPathFinder\noutperforms both original SliceLocator and GNNExplainer (as a general GNN\nexplainability tool) in discovery of vulnerability paths to identified PSPs."}

Specifically, we show that the hidden GNet outputs can still\nbe reliably estimated via query-based reverse engineering, leaking the\ngenerated and unmarked images, despite the attacker's limited knowledge of the\nsystem. Our first attempt is to reverse-engineer an inverse model for HNet\nunder the stringent black-box condition, for which we propose to exploit the\nquery process with specially curated input images.

Concept probing works by training additional\nclassifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined\nconcepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural\nnetworks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being\nprobed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data\nrequired to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.\nFocusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we\ninvestigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their\nperformance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used\ndatasets."}

It is developed by our\nproposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,\nsafety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of\nmulti-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that\nsimply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop\nintrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety\n`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of\n$46.54\\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks\nwithout compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety\nperformance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude\nOpus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct\ninference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,\nenforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop\nSafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and\nSafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and\ncapability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of\nour framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI."}

However, Rumsfeld ignorance is definable in terms of\nignorance, which makes some existing results and the axiomatization problem\ntrivial. A main reason is that the accessibility relations for the implicit\nknowledge operator contained in the packaged operators of ignorance and\nRumsfeld ignorance are the same. In this work, we assume the two accessibility\nrelations to be different so that one of them is an arbitrary subset of the\nother. This will avoid the definability issue and retain most of the previous\nvalidities. The main results are axiomatizations over various proper bi-frame\nclasses. Finally we apply our framework to analyze Fine's results."}

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most\nwidespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and\nremarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is\nrelatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA\nfine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).\nHowever, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more\ninformation leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we\nintroduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the\nfine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership\ninference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that\nleverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply\nLoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language\nprocessing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still\nvulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings).\nWe also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the\nresulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only\ndropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively\nmitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the\n\"pre-training and fine-tuning\" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model\nmakes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can\nprovide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers."}
