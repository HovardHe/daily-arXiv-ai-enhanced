### [1] [Consistent DAG selection for Bayesian causal discovery under general error distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00993)
*Anamitra Chaudhuri,Anirban Bhattacharya,Yang Ni*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种贝叶斯分层模型，用于学习变量间的因果结构，特别是在非高斯误差的线性递归结构方程模型（SEM）下识别真实的DAG结构。通过非标准DAG先验，证明了后验概率在样本量增大时收敛于真实DAG的分布等价类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决在非高斯误差的线性递归SEM下，如何从观测数据中学习变量间的因果结构，特别是识别真实的DAG结构。

Method: 方法包括提出贝叶斯分层模型，利用非高斯误差信息刻画真实DAG的分布等价类，并采用非标准DAG先验进行后验推断。

Result: 结果表明，在样本量增大时，后验概率收敛于真实DAG的分布等价类，实现了后验DAG选择的一致性，并通过模拟研究验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 结论是所提出的方法在非高斯误差条件下能够一致地识别真实DAG的分布等价类，为基于观测数据的因果结构学习提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the underlying causal structure among a
set of variables, which are assumed to follow a Bayesian network or, more
specifically, a linear recursive structural equation model (SEM) with the
associated errors being independent and allowed to be non-Gaussian. A Bayesian
hierarchical model is proposed to identify the true data-generating directed
acyclic graph (DAG) structure where the nodes and edges represent the variables
and the direct causal effects, respectively. Moreover, incorporating the
information of non-Gaussian errors, we characterize the distribution
equivalence class of the true DAG, which specifies the best possible extent to
which the DAG can be identified based on purely observational data.
Furthermore, under the consideration that the errors are distributed as some
scale mixture of Gaussian, where the mixing distribution is unspecified, and
mild distributional assumptions, we establish that by employing a non-standard
DAG prior, the posterior probability of the distribution equivalence class of
the true DAG converges to unity as the sample size grows. This shows that the
proposed method achieves the posterior DAG selection consistency, which is
further illustrated with examples and simulation studies.

### [2] [Asymptotic guarantees for Bayesian phylogenetic tree reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00995)
*Alisa Kirichenko,Luke J. Kelly,Jere Koskela*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: 本文提出了贝叶斯树重建程序一致性的可处理准则，适用于多种广泛使用的算法（如BEAST、MrBayes和RevBayes），无需对分支长度进行离散化或有界假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于为系统发育学中推断DNA序列样本共同祖先的贝叶斯树重建程序提供一致性的理论保证，克服现有方法对分支长度的限制性假设。

Method: 方法包括推导适用于不同树模型的通用准则，并在两种具体先验（Kingman凝聚先验和独立先验）上验证其适用性，强调方法对非二叉树模型的普适性。

Result: 结果表明，所得收敛速率与已知频率学派结果（在更强有界假设下获得）匹配，仅相差对数因子，验证了准则的实用性和灵活性。

Conclusion: 结论指出，该框架为贝叶斯树重建提供了无需严格假设的通用一致性保证，且易于适应不同推断问题的变体，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We derive tractable criteria for the consistency of Bayesian tree
reconstruction procedures, which constitute a central class of algorithms for
inferring common ancestry among DNA sequence samples in phylogenetics. Our
results encompass several Bayesian algorithms in widespread use, such as BEAST,
MrBayes, and RevBayes. Unlike essentially all existing asymptotic guarantees
for tree reconstruction, we require no discretization or boundedness
assumptions on branch lengths. Our results are also very flexible, and easy to
adapt to variations of the underlying inference problem. We demonstrate the
practicality of our criteria on two examples: a Kingman coalescent prior on
rooted, ultrametric trees, and an independence prior on unconstrained binary
trees, though we emphasize that our result also applies to non-binary tree
models. In both cases, the convergence rate we obtain matches known,
frequentist results obtained using stronger boundedness assumptions, up to
logarithmic factors.

### [3] [Likelihood Functions with Parameter-Dependent Support: A Survey of the Cramér-Rao-Leibniz Lower Bound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01145)
*Qin Lu,Yaakov Bar-Shalom,Peter Willett*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: 本文回顾了经典Cram\\'{e}r-Rao下界(CRLB)的推导条件，并针对参数依赖支撑集的情况，通过引入广义Leibniz积分规则，提出了Cram\\'{e}r-Rao-Leibniz下界(CRLLB)的统一框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键应用中，不仅需要点估计，还需评估估计量的不确定性边界。传统CRLB要求似然函数支撑集独立于待估参数，限制了其适用性。

Method: 通过广义Leibniz积分规则，将CRLB推广至支撑集依赖参数的CRLLB，并建立多维参数下的统一理论框架。

Result: CRLLB成功统一了现有CRLB和CRLLB结果，并通过典型似然函数案例验证了其在协方差边界计算中的有效性。

Conclusion: CRLLB框架突破了传统CRLB的支撑集限制，为更广泛场景下的估计精度评估提供了理论工具。

Abstract: Parameter estimation is a fundamental problem in science and engineering. In
many safety-critical applications, one is not only interested in a {\it point}
estimator, but also the uncertainty bound that can self-assess the accuracy of
the estimator. In this regard, the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is of
great importance, as it provides a lower bound on the variance of {\it any}
unbiased estimator. In many cases, it is the only way of evaluating, without
recourse to simulations, the expected accuracy of numerically obtainable
estimates. For the existence of the CRLB, there have been widely accepted
regularity conditions, one of which is that the support of the likelihood
function (LF) -- the pdf of the observations conditioned on the parameter of
interest -- should be independent of the parameter to be estimated. This paper
starts from reviewing the derivations of the classical CRLB under the condition
that the LF has parameter-independent support. To cope with the case of
parameter-dependent support, we generalize the CRLB to the {\it
Cram\'{e}r-Rao-Leibniz lower bound (CRLLB)}, by leveraging the general Leibniz
integral rule. Notably, the existing results on CRLLB and CRLB are unified
under the framework of CRLLB with multidimensional parameters. Then, we survey
existing examples of LFs to illustrate the usefulness of the CRLLB in providing
valid covariance bounds.

### [4] [M-estimation for Gaussian processes with time-inhomogeneous drifts from high-frequency data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01164)
*Yasutaka Shimizu*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: 提出一种基于对比的高频采样下非均匀漂移高斯过程估计方法，通过局部对比函数避免大矩阵求逆，证明了估计量的相合性与渐近正态性，并揭示了漂移估计的非标准收敛速率特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对高频采样下具有时变漂移的高斯过程，传统方法因大协方差矩阵求逆导致计算效率低下，需开发更高效的参数估计框架。

Method: 构建相邻增量的局部对比函数，将过程分解为确定性漂移函数与参数化核的平稳高斯分量，对不可识别参数引入矩校正方法。

Result: 在一般遍历性条件下，漂移估计量获得由漂移密度直接Riemann可积性导致的非标准收敛速率，协方差核参数估计具有渐近正态性。

Conclusion: 该框架计算高效且适应性强，特别适用于具有时变结构的高频数据推断，通过对比函数与矩校正的结合解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: We propose a contrast-based estimation method for Gaussian processes with
time-inhomogeneous drifts, observed under high-frequency sampling. The process
is modeled as the sum of a deterministic drift function and a stationary
Gaussian component with a parametric kernel. Our method constructs a local
contrast function from adjacent increments, which avoids inversion of large
covariance matrices and allows for efficient computation. We prove consistency
and asymptotic normality of the resulting estimators under general ergodicity
conditions. A distinctive feature of our approach is that the drift estimator
attains a nonstandard convergence rate, stemming from the direct Riemann
integrability of the drift density. This highlights a fundamental difference
from standard estimation regimes. Furthermore, when the local contrast fails to
identify all parameters in the covariance kernel, moment-based corrections can
be incorporated to recover identifiability. The proposed framework is simple,
flexible, and particularly well suited for high-frequency inference with
time-inhomogeneous structure.

### [5] [Central Limit Theorems for Transition Probabilities of Controlled Markov Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01517)
*Ziwei Su,Imon Banerjee,Diego Klabjan*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: 本文为有限状态-动作空间的受控马尔可夫链(CMC)开发了非参数估计量的中心极限定理(CLT)，建立了日志策略的精确条件，并推导了价值函数、Q函数和优势函数的CLT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是为离线策略评估和最优策略恢复提供新的统计工具，并实现对转移概率的假设检验。

Method: 方法包括开发非参数估计量的CLT，分析日志策略的渐近正态性条件，并基于此推导价值函数、Q函数和优势函数的CLT。

Result: 结果表明，在特定日志策略条件下，估计量具有渐近正态性，同时揭示了不存在CLT的情境，并推导了拟合优度检验。

Conclusion: 结论指出，这些结果为离线策略评估和最优策略恢复提供了统计基础，并支持对转移概率的假设检验。

Abstract: We develop a central limit theorem (CLT) for the non-parametric estimator of
the transition matrices in controlled Markov chains (CMCs) with finite
state-action spaces. Our results establish precise conditions on the logging
policy under which the estimator is asymptotically normal, and reveal settings
in which no CLT can exist. We then build upon it to derive CLTs for the value,
Q-, and advantage functions of any stationary stochastic policy, including the
optimal policy recovered from the estimated model. Goodness-of-fit tests are
derived as a corollary, which enable us to test whether the logged data is
stochastic. These results provide new statistical tools for offline policy
evaluation and optimal policy recovery, and enable hypothesis tests for
transition probabilities.

### [6] [From Thomas Bayes to Big Data: On the feasibility of being a subjective Bayesian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01642)
*Ya'acov Ritov*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: 本文质疑贝叶斯范式在超高维模型中的可行性，指出自然先验在无法忽略的参数值下会不可预测地失效，并认为这些贝叶斯方法实质上是频率学程序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探讨贝叶斯范式在超高维模型中的局限性，特别是先验分布无法真实反映统计学家信念的问题。

Method: 通过数学证明和不同案例展示主观贝叶斯观点的失败，分析Wald和Savage的经典论点对主观贝叶斯范式的适用性。

Result: 结果表明，自然先验在超高维模型中会不可预测地失效，且贝叶斯方法依赖于损失函数和特定功能，无法代表一致的参数信念。

Conclusion: 结论认为，超高维模型中的贝叶斯方法实质上是频率学技术的应用，而非真正的信念表达。

Abstract: We argue that the Bayesian paradigm, of a prior which represents the beliefs
of the statistician before observing the data, is not feasible in
ultra-high-dimensional models. We claim that natural priors that represent the
a priori beliefs fail in unpredictable ways under values of the parameters that
cannot be honestly ignored. We do not claim that the frequentist estimators we
present cannot be mimicked by Bayesian procedures, but that these Bayesian
procedures do not represent beliefs. They were created with the frequentist
analysis in mind, and in most cases, they cannot represent a consistent set of
beliefs about the parameters (for example, since they depend on the loss
function, the particular functional of interest, and not only on the a priori
knowledge, different priors should be used for different analyses of the same
data set). In a way, these are frequentist procedures using a Bayesian
technique.
  The paper presents different examples where the subjective point of view
fails. It is argued that the arguments based on Wald's and Savage's seminal
works are not relevant to the validity of the subjective Bayesian paradigm. The
discussion tries to deal with the fundamentals, but the argument is based on a
firm mathematical proofs.

### [7] [Distribution-free data-driven smooth tests without $χ^2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01973)
*Xiangyu Zhang,Sara Algeri*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: 本文基于经验过程理论的最新进展，提出了一种新的渐近分布自由的平滑检验统计量家族，其分布自由特性在参数估计、模型选择和中等样本量下仍能保持，并讨论了计算高效的参数自助法替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检验统计量在参数估计和模型选择后往往失去分布自由特性，且对小样本效果不佳，需要一种更稳健的检验方法。

Method: 利用经验过程理论构建新型平滑检验统计量，通过理论推导确保其渐近分布自由性，并提出计算高效的替代方案。

Result: 新方法在参数估计、模型选择和中等样本量情况下仍保持分布自由特性，其计算效率优于经典参数自助法。

Conclusion: 该研究为统计检验提供了更稳健的工具，特别适用于实际应用中常见的参数不确定性和中等样本量场景。

Abstract: This article demonstrates how recent developments in the theory of empirical
processes allow us to construct a new family of asymptotically
distribution-free smooth test statistics. Their distribution-free property is
preserved even when the parameters are estimated, model selection is performed,
and the sample size is only moderately large. A computationally efficient
alternative to the classical parametric bootstrap is also discussed.

### [8] [Estimation of Algebraic Sets: Extending PCA Beyond Linearity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01976)

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从含噪观测数据中恢复未知代数集$\mathcal{A}$的三步方法，包括构建矩矩阵、去偏及核提取，并提供了三种重建策略，证明了在温和正则条件下可恢复$\mathcal{A}$。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何从含噪的潜点观测中恢复未知代数集$\mathcal{A}$，扩展了主成分分析（纯线性情况）的应用范围。

Method: 方法分为三步：(i) 通过数据集的Vandermonde矩阵和多项式次数构建矩矩阵；(ii) 去偏以消除噪声引起的偏差；(iii) 通过特征值分解提取核，获得理想生成元系数的$n^{-1/2}$-一致估计。重建策略包括：(a) 计算拟合多项式的零点集；(b) 构建包含$\mathcal{A}$的半代数近似；(c) 在有结构先验信息时投影估计系数。

Result: 证明了（近乎）参数化的渐近误差界，并表明每种方法在温和正则条件下均可恢复$\mathcal{A}$。

Conclusion: 提出的三步法及三种重建策略能有效从含噪数据中恢复代数集$\mathcal{A}$，为非线性情况下的数据分析提供了理论保证。

Abstract: An algebraic set is defined as the zero locus of a system of real polynomial
equations. In this paper we address the problem of recovering an unknown
algebraic set $\mathcal{A}$ from noisy observations of latent points lying on
$\mathcal{A}$ -- a task that extends principal component analysis, which
corresponds to the purely linear case. Our procedure consists of three steps:
(i) constructing the {\it moment matrix} from the Vandermonde matrix associated
with the data set and the degree of the fitted polynomials, (ii) debiasing this
moment matrix to remove the noise-induced bias, (iii) extracting its kernel via
an eigenvalue decomposition of the debiased moment matrix. These steps yield
$n^{-1/2}$-consistent estimators of the coefficients of a set of generators for
the ideal of polynomials vanishing on $\mathcal{A}$. To reconstruct
$\mathcal{A}$ itself, we propose three complementary strategies: (a) compute
the zero set of the fitted polynomials; (b) build a semi-algebraic
approximation that encloses $\mathcal{A}$; (c) when structural prior
information is available, project the estimated coefficients onto the
corresponding constrained space. We prove (nearly) parametric asymptotic error
bounds and show that each approach recovers $\mathcal{A}$ under mild regularity
conditions.

Motivation: 在高斯两群分离问题中，已知最优判别投影方向可以在无标签信息的情况下估计。本文旨在收集并分析基于偏度的无监督估计方法，并比较其性能。

Method: 本文汇集了四种基于偏度的无监督估计方法，其中两种为新颖方法，另外两种为已有方法。通过推导这些估计量的极限分布，并利用仿真验证其有限样本行为。

Result: 研究结果表明，所有仿射等变的最优方向估计量具有成比例的渐近协方差矩阵，这使得它们的比较变得直接。仿真结果验证了理论推导并展示了估计量的有限样本性能。

Conclusion: 本文证明了无监督估计方法在高斯两群分离中的有效性，并通过理论分析和仿真验证了估计量的渐近性质和有限样本行为，为实际应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: It is well-known that, in Gaussian two-group separation, the optimally
discriminating projection direction can be estimated without any knowledge on
the group labels. In this work, we \revision{gather} several such unsupervised
estimators based on skewness and derive their limiting distributions. As one of
our main results, we show that all affine equivariant estimators of the optimal
direction have proportional asymptotic covariance matrices, making their
comparison straightforward. Two of our four estimators are novel and two have
been proposed already earlier. We use simulations to verify our results and to
inspect the finite-sample behaviors of the estimators.

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: 本文为含隐变量的参数模型建立了变分贝叶斯（VB）的有限样本理论，包括非渐近变分Bernstein--von Mises定理，并推导了VB估计量的一致性与渐近正态性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VB理论主要局限于固定维度或特定模型，本文旨在填补高维和大规模推断中VB理论空白。

Method: 在广泛参数模型类中构建VB后验的理论框架，应用非渐近分析技术。

Result: 证明了VB后验的理论性质，包括收敛速度与分布近似，并在多元高斯混合模型中验证。

Conclusion: 该理论框架拓展了VB的适用性，为复杂模型中的高效贝叶斯推断提供理论保障。

Abstract: Variational Bayes (VB) provides a computationally efficient alternative to
Markov Chain Monte Carlo, especially for high-dimensional and large-scale
inference. However, existing theory on VB primarily focuses on
fixed-dimensional settings or specific models. To address this limitation, this
paper develops a finite-sample theory for VB in a broad class of parametric
models with latent variables. We establish theoretical properties of the VB
posterior, including a non-asymptotic variational Bernstein--von Mises theorem.
Furthermore, we derive consistency and asymptotic normality of the VB
estimator. An application to multivariate Gaussian mixture models is presented
for illustration.

Abstract: This paper presents an exact and explicit equation for prime factorization,
along with an algorithm for its computation. The proposed method is based on
the MeLoCoToN approach, which addresses combinatorial optimization problems
through classical tensor networks. The presented tensor network performs the
multiplication of every pair of possible input numbers and selects those whose
product is the number to be factorized. Additionally, in order to make the
algorithm more efficient, the number and dimension of the tensors and their
contraction scheme are optimized. Finally, a series of tests on the algorithm
are conducted, contracting the tensor network both exactly and approximately
using tensor train compression, and evaluating its performance.

*Kenrick Howin Chai,Stefan Hildebrand,Tobias Lachnit,Martin Benfer,Gisela Lanza,Sandra Klinge*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 论文提出两种优化大型车队升级策略的方法：扩展整数规划与机器学习方法，后者在可扩展性和计算性能上显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 租赁商业模式和可持续性需求加剧了对高效车队升级策略的需求，传统整数规划方法因计算成本高难以应对大规模车队管理。

Method: 提出扩展整数规划方法优化升级决策，并引入机器学习方法将问题转化为混合离散-连续优化问题以降低计算负担。

Result: 汽车行业案例研究表明，机器学习方法能获得接近最优解，且在可扩展性和计算性能上显著提升。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法为大规模车队管理提供了实用的替代方案，兼顾优化效果与计算效率。

Abstract: Rental-based business models and increasing sustainability requirements
intensify the need for efficient strategies to manage large machine and vehicle
fleet renewal and upgrades. Optimized fleet upgrade strategies maximize overall
utility, cost, and sustainability. However, conventional fleet optimization
does not account for upgrade options and is based on integer programming with
exponential runtime scaling, which leads to substantial computational cost when
dealing with large fleets and repeated decision-making processes. This
contribution firstly suggests an extended integer programming approach that
determines optimal renewal and upgrade decisions. The computational burden is
addressed by a second, alternative machine learning-based method that
transforms the task to a mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem. Both
approaches are evaluated in a real-world automotive industry case study, which
shows that the machine learning approach achieves near-optimal solutions with
significant improvements in the scalability and overall computational
performance, thus making it a practical alternative for large-scale fleet
management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统整数阶模型无法准确捕捉微生物系统的时间依赖性与记忆效应，限制了水处理过程的优化潜力。本研究旨在通过分数阶微积分框架弥补这一缺陷，提升污染物降解效率。

Method: 1) 将二维分数阶系统降维为可计算的1D分数阶微分方程；2) 应用Schauder不动点定理证明周期解的存在唯一性；3) 基于分数阶庞特里亚金极大值原理推导Bang-Bang最优控制策略；4) 通过数值模拟验证性能。关键参数包括分数阶$\alpha$、动态缩放参数$\vartheta$和记忆长度L。

Result: 数值实验表明：分数阶周期控制较稳态运行可降低40%的底物平均浓度，记忆效应、控制响应速度与切换频率由$\alpha$、$\vartheta$和L共同决定。

Conclusion: 该研究将分数阶微积分与环境工程相结合，为设计高效可持续的水处理系统提供了新范式，证实了分数阶控制在提升污染物去除效率方面的显著优势。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel fractional-order chemostat model (FOCM) for
optimizing biological water treatment processes, incorporating memory effects
through the use of Caputo fractional derivative with sliding memory (CFDS).
Traditional integer-order models fail to capture the time-dependent behaviors
and memory effects inherent in microbial systems. Our work addresses this
limitation by developing a fractional-order framework that represents microbial
growth and substrate degradation dynamics more accurately. The primary
objective is to minimize the average pollutant concentration in treated water
through optimal periodic control (OPC) of the dilution rate, subject to
constraints on treatment capacity and periodic boundary conditions. Key
contributions include: (1) reduction of the 2D fractional-order system to a
computationally tractable 1D fractional differential equation while preserving
essential dynamics; (2) rigorous proof of the existence and uniqueness of
optimal periodic solutions using Schauder's fixed-point theorem and convexity
arguments; (3) derivation of bang-bang optimal control (OC) strategies by using
a fractional Pontryagin maximum principle (PMP); and (4) comprehensive
numerical simulations demonstrating significant performance improvements over
steady-state operation. Our results show that periodic fractional control can
reduce average substrate concentrations by up to 40% compared to steady-state
operation, with the fractional order {\alpha}, the dynamic scaling parameter
$\vartheta$, and the sliding memory length L serving as critical factors that
govern memory effects, control responsiveness, and switching frequency. The
proposed framework bridges fractional calculus with environmental engineering,
offering new insights for designing sustainable water treatment systems with
improved pollutant removal efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为提高最后一公里配送系统的可靠性和客户满意度，需设计既考虑时间窗长度又兼顾违约风险的服务时间窗口。

Method: 基于随机优化和分布鲁棒优化框架，分别推导出最优时间窗的闭式解，并研究固定宽度时间窗及等待策略，最后将时间窗设计与路径优化整合为统一框架。

Result: 随机优化模型在样本外测试中少量违约，而分布鲁棒模型始终在风险容忍度内提供可靠路径和时间窗，且框架兼容现有路径规划方案。

Conclusion: 所提框架可根据风险偏好定制时间窗，并在可控服务保障水平下生成高效路径，为服务商提供灵活可靠的决策工具。

Abstract: Our study focuses on designing reliable service time windows for customers in
a last-mile delivery system to boost dependability and enhance customer
satisfaction. To construct time windows for a pre-determined route (e.g.,
provided by commercial routing software), we introduce two criteria that
balance window length and the risk of violation. The service provider can
allocate different penalties reflecting risk tolerances to each criterion,
resulting in various time windows with varying levels of service guarantee.
Depending on the degree of information available about the travel time
distribution, we develop two modeling frameworks based on stochastic and
distributionally robust optimization. In each setting, we derive closed-form
solutions for the optimal time windows, which are functions of risk preferences
and the sequence of visits. We further investigate fixed-width time windows,
which standardize service intervals, and the use of a policy that allows
vehicles arriving before the lower bounds to wait rather than incur a penalty.
Next, we integrate service time window design with routing optimization into a
unified framework that simultaneously determines optimal routing and time
window allocations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our models on a rich
collection of instances from well-known datasets. While a small portion of the
time windows designed by the stochastic model was violated in out-of-sample
tests, the distributionally robust model consistently delivered routes and time
windows within the service provider's risk tolerance. Our proposed frameworks
are readily compatible with existing routing solutions, enabling service
providers to design time windows aligned with their risk preferences. It can
also be leveraged to produce the most efficient routes with narrow time windows
that meet operational constraints at controlled levels of service guarantee.

### [15] [Quotients of Invariant Control Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01038)
*Taylor J. Klotz,Peter J. Vassiliou*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文研究了控制系统的对称性约简，证明了静态反馈线性化（SFL）在对称约简下的保持性，并基于几何性质对$G$-不变控制系统的SFL约简进行了分类。


<details>

Motivation: 先前研究表明，具有对称群$G$的控制系统$\mathcal{V}$常存在静态反馈线性化（SFL）的群商（对称约简），可用于动态反馈线性化或部分反馈线性化的系统构造。因此，本文旨在深入分析对称约简的几何机制及其应用。

Conclusion: 对称约简为控制系统的线性化提供了系统性方法，几何分析揭示了SFL约简频繁出现的深层原因。广义S-G-S测试和PVTOL案例验证了理论的实用性和普适性。

Abstract: In previous work it was shown that if a control system $\mathcal{V}\subset
TM$ on manifold $M$ has a control symmetry group $G$ then it very often has
group quotients (or symmetry reductions) $\mathcal{V}/G$ which are static
feedback linearizable (SFL). This, in turn, can be applied to systematically
construct dynamic feedback linearizations of $\mathcal{V}$; or to construct
partial feedback linearizations, when no dynamic feedback linearization exists.
Because of these and related applications, this paper makes a detailed study of
symmetry reduction for control systems. We show that a key property involved in
the symmetry reduction of control systems is that of transversality of Lie
group actions. Generalizing this notion, we provide an analysis of how the
geometry of an invariant distribution, and particularly a control system, is
altered as a consequence of symmetry reduction. This provides important
information toward understanding the unexpectedly frequent occurrence of SFL
quotients. Specifically, we detail how the integrability properties and ranks
of various canonical sub-bundles of the quotient object differ from those of
the given distribution. As a consequence we are able to classify the SFL
quotients of $G$-invariant control systems $\mathcal{V}$ based upon the
geometric properties of $\mathcal{V}$ and the action $G$. Additionally, we
prove that static feedback linearizability is preserved by symmetry reduction
and the well-known Sluis-Gardner-Shadwick (S-G-S) test for the static feedback
linearization of control systems is extended to Goursat bundles. A generalized
S-G-S test to identify if $\mathcal{V}/G$ is a Goursat bundle is also given,
based on the Lie algebra of $G$. Finally, we apply all our results to the
well-known PVTOL control system and demonstrate that it may be viewed as an
invariant control system on a certain 9-dimensional Lie group.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多参数规划（mp）替代模型的Benders分解加速框架，通过Plasmo$.$jl的OptiGraph抽象建模图结构问题，显著减少子问题求解时间并保持收敛性，应用于两阶段随机规划问题验证了其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Benders分解因重复求解子问题导致效率低下，本文旨在通过mp替代模型减少计算开销，同时利用图结构分解提升可扩展性。

Method: 使用Plasmo$.$jl的OptiGraph对图结构问题建模，通过mp一次性求解节点子问题并提取显式分段仿射映射，替代迭代中的子问题求解，开发了开源工具PlasmoBenders$.$jl。

Result: mp替代方法在子问题求解时间上实现显著加速，保持Benders收敛性，且通过mp临界区域追踪增强解的分析与可解释性。两阶段随机规划案例验证了单/多cut变体的性能提升。

Conclusion: 结合mp与图建模的分解框架为结构化解提供了可扩展基础，mp替代模型统一了异构子问题的表示，同时克服了mp的可扩展性限制。

Abstract: Benders decomposition is a widely used method for solving large optimization
problems, but its performance is often hindered by the repeated solution of
subproblems. We propose a flexible and modular algorithmic framework for
accelerating Benders decomposition by embedding multi-parametric programming
(mp) surrogates for optimization subproblems. Our approach leverages the
OptiGraph abstraction in Plasmo$.$jl to model and decompose graph-structured
problems. By solving the subproblems associated with the graph nodes once using
mp, we can extract explicit piecewise affine mappings for primal and dual
variables which replace the expensive subproblem solves with efficient look-ups
and function evaluations during the iterative Benders process. We formally show
the equivalence between classical Benders cuts and those derived from the mp
solution and implement this integration in the open-source PlasmoBenders$.$jl
software package. We apply it to a two-stage stochastic programming problem,
which aims to make optimal capacity expansion decisions under uncertainty in
product demand/prices and availability of raw materials. We evaluate single-cut
and multi-cut variants of Benders and show that the mp surrogate approach
achieves substantial speedups in subproblem solve time while preserving the
convergence guarantees of Benders. Furthermore, we highlight advantages in the
solution analysis and interpretability that is enabled by mp critical region
tracking. Our results demonstrate that combining mp programming with graph
modeling offers a promising and extensible foundation for structure-exploiting
decomposition. By decomposing the problem into tractable subproblems, the
proposed approach also aims to overcome scalability issues of mp, and the use
of mp surrogates provides a unifying modeling framework to represent
heterogeneous graph subproblems as common modeling objects.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了切片Wasserstein距离的局限性及其改进方法，提出了Pivot Sliced Discrepancy新指标，并推广了Expected Sliced plans方法，通过理论分析和实验验证了其在色彩迁移和形状配准等任务中的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 切片Wasserstein距离虽在图像处理和机器学习中广泛应用，但其无法生成传输计划的特性限制了实际应用。近年来针对离散概率测量的改进方法缺乏普适性理论分析。

Method: 基于$\nu$-Wasserstein距离和广义测地线，提出Pivot Sliced Discrepancy新指标；推广Liu等人的Expected Sliced plans方法至通用概率测量，建立其与约束Kantorovich问题的理论关联。

Result: 理论证明了Pivot Sliced Discrepancy的半度量性质，通过合成数据和真实数据（包括色彩迁移和形状配准）实验验证了各改进方案的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究为切片Wasserstein距离的传输计划生成问题提供了普适性理论框架，Pivot Sliced Discrepancy和广义Expected Sliced plans在应用中展现出实用价值。

Abstract: Since the introduction of the Sliced Wasserstein distance in the literature,
its simplicity and efficiency have made it one of the most interesting
surrogate for the Wasserstein distance in image processing and machine
learning. However, its inability to produce transport plans limits its
practical use to applications where only a distance is necessary. Several
heuristics have been proposed in the recent years to address this limitation
when the probability measures are discrete. In this paper, we propose to study
these different propositions by redefining and analysing them rigorously for
generic probability measures. Leveraging the $\nu$-based Wasserstein distance
and generalised geodesics, we introduce and study the Pivot Sliced Discrepancy,
inspired by a recent work by Mahey et al.. We demonstrate its semi-metric
properties and its relation to a constrained Kantorovich formulation. In the
same way, we generalise and study the recent Expected Sliced plans introduced
by Liu et al. for completely generic measures. Our theoretical contributions
are supported by numerical experiments on synthetic and real datasets,
including colour transfer and shape registration, evaluating the practical
relevance of these different solutions.

Motivation: 研究SAA方法在随机最优控制中的统计特性，特别是其价值函数的极限分布，以理解统计不确定性在多阶段问题中的传播机制。

Method: 利用动态规划原理和反向归纳法，结合随机等度连续条件，推导SAA价值函数的极限分布，并通过线性二次调节器(LQR)问题进行实例验证。

Result: 各阶段的渐近方差可分解为当前阶段方差和传播的未来方差两部分，LQR问题虽超出框架假设但能显式计算这两部分方差。

Conclusion: 方差分解清晰地展示了统计不确定性在时间维度上的反向传播规律，为随机最优控制的SAA方法提供了理论支撑。

Abstract: We establish central limit theorems for the Sample Average Approximation
(SAA) method in discrete-time, finite-horizon Stochastic Optimal Control. Using
the dynamic programming principle and backward induction, we characterize the
limiting distributions of the SAA value functions. The asymptotic variance at
each stage decomposes into two components: a current-stage variance arising
from immediate randomness, and a propagated future variance accumulated from
subsequent stages. This decomposition clarifies how statistical uncertainty
propagates backward through time. Our derivation relies on a stochastic
equicontinuity condition, for which we provide sufficient conditions. We
illustrate the variance decomposition using the classical Linear Quadratic
Regulator (LQR) problem. Although its unbounded state and control spaces
violate the compactness assumptions of our framework, the LQR setting enables
explicit computation and visualization of both variance components.

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在多种问题类型中均优于现有方法，验证了其竞争性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为凸复合优化提供了更通用的自适应框架，突破了传统全局假设的限制，具有显著的实用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces adaptive Bregman proximal gradient algorithms for
solving convex composite minimization problems without relying on global
relative smoothness or strong convexity assumptions. Building upon recent
advances in adaptive stepsize selections, the proposed methods generate
stepsizes based on local curvature estimates, entirely eliminating the need for
backtracking linesearch. A key innovation is a Bregman generalization of
Young's inequality, which allows controlling a critical inner product in terms
of the same Bregman distances used in the updates. Our theory applies to
problems where the differentiable term is merely locally smooth relative to a
distance-generating function, without requiring the existence of global moduli
or symmetry coefficients. Numerical experiments demonstrate their competitive
performance compared to existing approaches across various problem classes.

Abstract: The paper studies decentralized optimization over networks, where agents
minimize a composite objective consisting of the sum of smooth convex
functions--the agents' losses--and an additional nonsmooth convex extended
value function. We propose a decentralized algorithm wherein agents ${\it
adaptively}$ adjust their stepsize using local backtracking procedures that
require ${\it no}$ ${\it global}$ (network) information or extensive
inter-agent communications. Our adaptive decentralized method enjoys robust
convergence guarantees, outperforming existing decentralized methods, which are
not adaptive. Our design is centered on a three-operator splitting, applied to
a reformulation of the optimization problem. This reformulation utilizes a
proposed BCV metric, which facilitates decentralized implementation and local
stepsize adjustments while guarantying convergence.

Abstract: This paper investigates an indefinite linear-quadratic partially observed
mean-field game with common noise, incorporating both state-average and
control-average effects. In our model, each agent's state is observed through
both individual and public observations, which are modeled as general
stochastic processes rather than Brownian motions. {It is noteworthy that} the
weighting matrices in the cost functional are allowed to be indefinite. We
derive the optimal decentralized strategies using the Hamiltonian approach and
establish the well-posedness of the resulting Hamiltonian system by employing a
relaxed compensator. The associated consistency condition and the feedback
representation of decentralized strategies are also established. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that the set of decentralized strategies form an
$\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium. As an application, we solve a mean-variance

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少船舶航行过程中产生的水下辐射噪声对海洋哺乳动物（如南方居留型虎鲸）的影响，保护海洋生态环境。

Abstract: We present a novel MUTE-DSS, a digital-twin-based decision support system for
minimizing underwater radiated noise (URN) during ship voyage planning. It is a
ROS2-centric framework that integrates state-of-the-art acoustic models
combining a semi-empirical reference spectrum for near-field modeling with 3D
ray tracing for propagation losses for far-field modeling, offering real-time
computation of the ship noise signature, alongside a data-driven Southern
resident killer whale distribution model. The proposed DSS performs a two-stage
optimization pipeline: Batch Informed Trees for collision-free ship routing and
a genetic algorithm for adaptive ship speed profiling under voyage constraints
that minimizes cumulative URN exposure to marine mammals. The effectiveness of
MUTE-DSS is demonstrated through case studies of ships operating between the
Strait of Georgia and the Strait of Juan de Fuca, comparing optimized voyages
against baseline trajectories derived from automatic identification system
data. Results show substantial reductions in noise exposure level, up to 7.14
dB, corresponding to approximately an 80.68% reduction in a simplified
scenario, and an average 4.90 dB reduction, corresponding to approximately a
67.6% reduction in a more realistic dynamic setting. These results illustrate
the adaptability and practical utility of the proposed decision support system.

equilibria in these distributed settings, and in particular for crowd motion
games.
  Our theoretical results are supported by numerical implementations using

Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing a multivariate quadratic function where
each decision variable is constrained to be a complex $m$'th root of unity.
Such problems have applications in signal processing, MIMO detection, and the
computation of ground states in statistical physics, among others. Our
contributions in this paper are twofold. We first study the convergence of the
sum-of-squares hierarchy and prove its convergence to the exact solution after
only $\lfloor n/2\rfloor+1$ levels (as opposed to $n$ levels). Our proof
follows and generalizes the techniques and results used for the binary $m=2$
case developed by Fawzi, Saunderson, Parrilo. Second, we construct an integer
binary reformulation of the problem based on zonotopes which reduces by half
the number of binary variables in the simple reformulation. We show on
numerical experiments that this reformulation can result in significant
speedups (up to 10x) in solution time.

Abstract: This paper considers distributed resource allocation problems (DRAPs) with a
coupled constraint for real-time systems. Based on primal-dual methods, we
adopt a control perspective for optimization algorithm design by synthesizing a
safe feedback controller using control barrier functions to enforce constraint
satisfaction. On this basis, a distributed anytime-feasible resource allocation
(DanyRA) algorithm is proposed. It is shown that DanyRA algorithm converges to
the exact optimal solution of DRAPs while ensuring feasibility of the coupled
inequality constraint at all time steps. Considering constraint violation
arises from potential external interferences, a virtual queue with minimum
buffer is incorporated to restore the constraint satisfaction before the
pre-defined deadlines. We characterize the trade-off between convergence
accuracy and violation robustness for maintaining or recovering feasibility.
DanyRA algorithm is further extended to address DRAPs with a coupled equality
constraint, and its linear convergence rate is theoretically established.
Finally, a numerical example is provided for verification.

Abstract: A topology optimization problem in a phase field setting is considered to
obtain rigid structures, which are resilient to external forces and
constructable with additive manufacturing. Hence, large deformations of
overhangs due to gravity shall be avoided during construction. The deformations
depend on the stage of the construction and are modelled by linear elasticity
equations on growing domains with height-dependent stress tensors and forces.
Herewith, possible hardening effects can be included. Analytical results
concerning the existence of minimizers and the differentiability of the reduced
cost functional are presented in case of a finite number of construction
layers. By proving Korn's inequality with a constant independent of the height,
it is shown that the cost functional, formulated continuously in height, is
well-defined. The problem is numerically solved using a projected gradient type
method in function space, for which applicability is shown. Second-order
information can be included by adapting the underlying inner product in every
iteration. Additional adjustments enhancing the solver's performance, such as a
nested procedure and subsystem solver specifcations, are stated. Numerical
evidence is provided that for all discretization level and also for any number
of construction layers, the iteration numbers stay roughly constant. The
benefits of the nested procedure as well as of the inclusion of second order
information are illustrated. Furthermore, the choice of weights for the
penalization of overhangs is discussed. For various problem settings, results
are presented for one or two materials and void in two as well as in three
dimensions.

Motivation: 格理论中寻找最短向量是一个核心问题，尤其在无穷范数下对整数矩阵生成的格，该问题的计算复杂性及高效算法设计具有重要意义。

Method: 通过分析矩阵子行列式的最大绝对值$\Delta$，证明了当维度$n$超过由$\Delta$决定的阈值时，最短向量的无穷范数必为1，并基于此设计了固定参数算法。

Result: 发现了一个维度阈值现象：当$n$足够大时，最短向量范数恒为1；同时证明了整数最优解位于维度仅与$\Delta$相关的多面体面上。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提供了最短向量问题的固定参数算法，还揭示了维度与解结构的深层关系，对整数规划等领域具有应用价值。

Abstract: One important question in the theory of lattices is to detect a shortest
vector: given a norm and a lattice, what is the smallest norm attained by a
non-zero vector contained in the lattice? We focus on the infinity norm and
work with lattices of the form $A\mathbb{Z}^n$, where $A$ has integer entries
and is of full column rank. Finding a shortest vector is NP-hard. We show that
this task is fixed parameter tractable in the parameter $\Delta$, the largest
absolute value of the determinant of a full rank submatrix of $A$. The
algorithm is based on a structural result that can be interpreted as a
threshold phenomenon: whenever the dimension $n$ exceeds a certain value
determined only by $\Delta$, then a shortest lattice vector attains an infinity
norm value of one. This threshold phenomenon has several applications. In
particular, it reveals that integer optimal solutions lie on faces of the given
polyhedron whose dimensions are bounded only in terms of $\Delta$.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出一种新型算法，用于解决非凸、非线性等式约束的有限和优化问题，结合二次惩罚方法与自适应采样策略，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对非凸非线性等式约束的有限和优化问题，现有方法计算成本高且缺乏灵活性，需开发高效且通用的求解算法。

Method: 算法在二次惩罚方法框架中引入自适应采样策略，支持从迷你批次到全样本的灵活调整，并采用非单调线搜索与自适应惩罚参数，避免昂贵投影操作。

Result: 理论证明算法在标准假设下几乎必然收敛，数值实验（包括学术与真实机器学习问题）验证了其高效性。

Conclusion: 该算法将无约束/线性约束问题的采样策略推广至非线性约束场景，兼具计算效率与理论保证，为复杂优化问题提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for solving non-convex, nonlinear
equality-constrained finite-sum optimization problems. The proposed algorithm
incorporates an additional sampling strategy for sample size update into the
well-known framework of quadratic penalty methods. Thus, depending on the
problem at hand, the resulting method may exhibit a sample size strategy
ranging from a mini-batch on one end, to increasing sample size that achieves
the full sample eventually, on the other end of the spectrum. A non-monotone
line search is used for the step size update, while the penalty parameter is
also adaptive. The proposed algorithm avoids costly projections, which,
together with the sample size update, may yield significant computational cost
savings. Also, the proposed method can be viewed as a transition of an
additional sampling approach for unconstrained and linear constrained problems,
to a more general class with non-linear constraints. The almost sure
convergence is proved under a standard set of assumptions for this framework,
while numerical experiments on both academic and real-data based machine
learning problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Result: 证明了平均可控性可由平均Kalman秩条件表征，并通过平均Gramian矩阵实现了最小能量控制设计。

Conclusion: 理论结果推广了经典整数阶系统的可控性结论，数值仿真验证了分数阶R\"ossler系统的有效性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the controllability of finite-dimensional linear
fractional systems involving an uncertain parameter. We establish new results
on the simultaneous and average controllability. In particular, we show that
average controllability can be characterized by the so-called average Kalman
rank condition and the average Gramian matrix. Moreover, using the average
Gramian matrix, we design an open-loop control with minimal energy. These
results can be seen as a natural generalization of the classical results known
for systems with integer-order derivatives. Finally, numerical simulations are
provided to robustly validate the theoretical findings, with a focus on the
fractional R\"ossler system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖扰动论证或施加严格条件（如高折现率或有界策略）来确保问题适定性，存在局限性。

Method: 利用问题的齐次性直接求解Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman方程，无需横截性条件即可验证候选策略的最优性。

Abstract: This paper revisits the classical Merton portfolio choice problem over
infinite horizon for high risk aversion, addressing technical challenges
related to establishing the existence and identification of optimal strategies.
Traditional methods rely on perturbation arguments and/or impose restrictive
conditions, such as large discount rates and/or bounded strategies, to ensure
well-posedness. Our approach leverages the problem's homogeneity to directly
solve the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and verify the optimality
of candidate strategies without requiring transversality conditions.

TL;DR: 本文研究了损失集群情况下的最优再保险合约形式，基于标记霍克斯过程建模，推导出均值-方差框架下的闭式解，发现最优合约并非传统超额损失形式，而是分段线性结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨损失集群环境下再保险合约的最优形式，传统超额损失合约在此情境下可能不再适用，需考虑损失事件的时空依赖性。

Method: 使用标记霍克斯过程建模 insured risk（标记点过程），其强度函数同时受历史事件发生时间和损失规模影响，在均值-方差框架下进行数学推导。

Result: 最优再保险合约呈现三段式结构：1) 阈值以下不投保；2) 中间段再保险斜率大于1；3) 高损失段全额再保险。当过程退化为泊松过程时，最优合约恢复为传统免赔额形式。

Conclusion: 损失事件的集群特性会根本改变最优再保险合约结构，传统超额损失合约仅在泊松过程假设下最优，研究结果为非独立同分布风险提供了合约设计新范式。

Abstract: This paper investigates the form of optimal reinsurance contracts in the case
of clusters of losses. The underlying insured risk is represented by a marked
Hawkes process, where the intensity of the jumps depends not only on the
occurrence of previous jumps but also on the size of the jumps, which
represents the financial magnitude of the loss. The reinsurance contracts are
applied to each loss at the time of occurrence, but their structure is assumed
to be constant. We derive closed-form formulas within the meanvariance
framework. Additionally, we demonstrate that the optimal contract is not the
classical excess-loss (deductible) form. The optimal contract is piecewise
linear with three ranges: first, no reinsurance below a certain threshold;
second, reinsurance with a slope greater than 1; and finally, full reinsurance.
When the marked process converges to a Poisson process, we recover the
optimality of the deductible form.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化使降雨模式极端化（短期强降雨与长期干旱交替），需研究大坝在保证下游功能的同时如何平衡洪水与干旱风险。

Method: 采用Hawkes过程（具有时间相关强度的自激励过程）模拟极端降雨事件，建立带约束的最优切换控制模型，并给出数值求解方法。

Result: 数值分析显示：自激励参数增大时最优水位反而上升，表明洪水漫顶风险优先于干旱风险，颠覆传统认知。

Conclusion: 大坝功能将逐渐从蓄水储备转向防洪主导，反映气候变化下水资源管理的范式转变。

Abstract: Climate change has a dramatic impact, particularly by concentrating rainfall
into a few short periods, interspersed by long dry spells. In this context, the
role of dams is crucial. We consider the optimal control of a dam, where the
water level must not exceed a designated safety threshold, nor fall below a
minimum level to ensure functionality and sustainability for for the outgoing
river. To model dry spells and intense rainfall events, commonly referred to as
water bombs, we introduce a Hawkes process, a well-known example of a
self-exciting process characterised by time-correlated intensity, which
endogenously reproduces the concentration of events. The problem is formulated
as an optimal switching problem with constraints. We establish existence
results and propose numerical methods for approximating the solution. Finally,
we illustrate the main achievements of this approach through numerical
examples. The main and counterintuitive result of our numerical analysis is
that the optimal water level inside the dam increases with the self-exciting
parameter. This result shows that, when facing the dilemma of managing the
opposing risks of dam overtopping and dry spells, the former ultimately
dominates the latter. In conclusion, dams will increasingly lose their role as
water reserves and take on a greater role in flood protection.

Result: 模型可在秒级时间内求解25架飞机的最优解，对40架飞机的大规模案例也能在已知最优间隙内提供高质量解，始终显著优于启发式方法。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅具有显著经济效益，还为解决方案时间与最优性之间的权衡提供了重要管理启示，验证了连续时间方法的优越性。

Abstract: Efficient management of aircraft maintenance hangars is a critical
operational challenge, involving complex, interdependent decisions regarding
aircraft scheduling and spatial allocation. This paper introduces a novel
continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to solve this
integrated spatio-temporal problem. By treating time as a continuous variable,
our formulation overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional
discrete-time approaches. The performance of the exact model is benchmarked
against a constructive heuristic, and its practical applicability is
demonstrated through a custom-built visualization dashboard. Computational
results are compelling: the model solves instances with up to 25 aircraft to
proven optimality, often in mere seconds, and for large-scale cases of up to 40
aircraft, delivers high-quality solutions within known optimality gaps. In all
tested scenarios, the resulting solutions consistently and significantly
outperform the heuristic, which highlights the framework's substantial economic
benefits and provides valuable managerial insights into the trade-off between
solution time and optimality.

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于Laplace算子特征函数设计的有限维反馈控制器可有效稳定带记忆项的广义Burgers-Huxley方程，为解决非齐次边界条件下的稳定性问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we study a generalized Burgers-Huxley equation with memory,
subject to nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. We construct a linear,
finite-dimensional Dirichlet boundary feedback controller aimed at stabilizing
the stationary solution corresponding to the homogeneous boundary condition.
This controller is designed using eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator. We
begin by analyzing the stabilization of a linear system under the proposed
feedback law. Subsequently, we demonstrate that the same controller also
stabilizes the full nonlinear system by applying the Banach fixed point
theorem. Finally, we provide a remark on the stabilization of the generalized
Burgers-Huxley equation with memory around the zero solution under
nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new formulation and solution framework for hub
location problems. The formulation is based on 2-index aggregated flow
variables and incorporates a set of aggregated demand constraints, which are
novel in hub location. With minor adaptations, the approach applies to a large
class of single- and multiple-allocation models, possibly incorporating flow
bounds on activated arcs. General-purpose feasibility and optimality
inequalities are also developed. Because of the small number of continuous
variables, there is no need to project them out, differentiating the method
from solution algorithms that rely heavily on feasibility and optimality cuts.
The proposed Branch & Solve solution framework leverages the nested structure
of the problems, by solving auxiliary subproblems at selected nodes of the
enumeration tree. Extensive computational experiments on benchmark instances
from the literature confirm the good performance of the proposal: the basic
version of the algorithm is able to solve to proven optimality instances with
up to 200 nodes for several hub location families.

Abstract: The characterization of permutations over finite fields is an important topic
in number theory with a long-standing history. This paper presents a systematic
investigation of low-degree bivariate polynomial systems
$F=(f_1(x,y),f_2(x,y))$ defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q}^2$. Specifically, we
employ Hermite's Criterion to completely classify bivariate quadratic
permutation polynomial systems, while utilizing the theory of permutation
rational functions to give a full classification of bivariate 3-homogeneous
permutation polynomial systems. Furthermore, as an application of our findings,
we provide an explicit characterization of the permutation binomials of the
form $x^3+ax^{2q+1}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ with characteristic $p\neq3$,
thereby resolving a significant special case within this classical research
domain.

Combining a generalization of an argument of Altman with Moshkovitz--Zhu's

(slightly) improve the best known lower bounds (due to Bri\"et) on the size
$|S|$ required for Szemer\'edi's theorem with difference in $S$ to hold

Method: 通过簇对称性视角建立新框架，给出Laurent多项式在簇对称映射下不变的必要充分条件，并构造判别算法以确定其是否允许簇对称对及能否在广义簇代数中实现。

Result: 应用该框架解决了两个Diophantine方程，描述了三类不变Laurent多项式环，回答了Gyoda和Matsushita的两个问题，并提供了两个Matlab程序用于构造不变Laurent多项式及寻找簇对称对。

Conclusion: 研究成功将簇理论应用于Diophantine方程求解，提供了理论框架与实用工具，拓展了簇对称性在数学问题中的应用范围。

Abstract: This paper aims to use a cluster-theoretic approach to give a kind of
Diophantine equation whose solutions can be obtained by starting from initial
solutions through mutations.
  We establish a novel framework bridging cluster theory and Diophantine
equations through the lens of cluster symmetry. On the one hand, we give the
necessary and sufficient condition for Laurent polynomials to remain invariant
under a given cluster symmetric map. On the other hand, we construct a
discriminant algorithm to determine whether the corresponding Laurent
polynomial admits a cluster symmetric pair and whether it can be realized in a
generalized cluster algebra.
  As applications of this framework, we solve two Diophantine equations,
describe three classes of invariant Laurent polynomial rings, resolve two
questions posed by Gyoda and Matsushita in \cite{Gyoda}, and lastly give two
Matlab programs, respectively, for constructing invariant Laurent polynomials
and finding cluster symmetric pairs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于改进黎曼ζ函数在σ接近1时的零密度估计，并优化素数定理中的误差项，以提供更精确的数学分析工具。

Method: 通过分析Korobov-Vinogradov无零区域的左边缘附近σ的行为，提出了一种新的零密度估计方法，并利用函数ν(t)的性质进行推导。

Result: 结果表明，当σ足够接近1时，N(σ,T)可以被绝对常数限制，且素数定理中的误差项可以取ε=0，即误差项达到最优形式。

Conclusion: 本文不仅改进了黎曼ζ函数的零密度估计，还为素数定理提供了最优误差项，具有重要的理论意义和应用价值。

Abstract: We will provide a new type of zero-density estimate for $\zeta(s)$ when
$\sigma$ is sufficiently close to $1$. In particular, we will show that
$N(\sigma,T)$ can be bounded by an absolute constant when $\sigma$ is
sufficiently close to the left edge of the Korobov-Vinogradov zero-free region.
As a consequence, we provide the optimal error term in the prime number theorem
of the form $$ \psi(x)-x \ll x\exp \left\{-(1-\varepsilon)
\omega(x)\right\},\qquad \omega(x):=\min _{t \geq 1}\{\nu(t) \log x+\log t\},
$$ where $\nu(t)=A_0(\log t)^{-2/3}(\log\log t)^{-1/3}$ is a decreasing
function such that $\zeta(\sigma+it)\neq 0$ for $\sigma\ge 1-\nu(t)$.
Precisely, we will show that we can take $\varepsilon=0$.

Motivation: 探讨非Hecke特征$\psi$对$L$-函数的影响，揭示其独特的解析特性及在数论中的潜在应用价值。

Method: 定义素数理想$\mathfrak{p}$上的乘法特征$\psi(p)=\alpha^{N(\mathfrak{p})}$，并扩展为连续非Hecke特征，分析$|\alpha|<1$时$\psi$-扭曲$L$-函数的性质。

Result: 获得$\psi$-扭曲$L$-函数的绝对收敛半平面扩展、欧拉积结构保持性、亚纯延拓，并构建收敛的$p$-adic狄利克雷级数与欧拉积。

Conclusion: $\psi$-扭曲技术为$L$-函数研究提供了新工具，特别适用于模形式与$p$-adic分析领域，拓展了经典理论的边界。

Abstract: We investigate the twisting of motivic $L$-functions by a family of
multiplicative characters $\psi$, defined on prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}$ via
$\psi(p)=\alpha^{N(\mathfrak{p})}$ for a fixed $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$. One can
extend $\psi$ to a continuous non-Hecke character on the idele group of a
number field. For $|\alpha|<1$, the resulting $\psi$-twisted $L$-function has
interesting analytic properties: an enhanced half-plane of absolute
convergence, preservation of the Euler product structure, and meromorphic
continuation to the complex plane. We give applications to Dirichlet
$L$-functions and $L$-functions associated to modular forms. Furthermore, we
show that $\psi$-twisting allows the construction of convergent $p$-adic
Dirichlet series and $p$-adic Euler products.

TL;DR: 在I2大基数公理假设下，研究证明了存在由两个生成元生成的自由左分配代数，扩展了Laver关于单生成元自由左分配代数的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Laver先前证明了在I3大基数公理下，单生成元的秩到秩嵌入生成自由左分配代数。本文探讨是否能在更强的大基数假设下，构建多生成元的自由左分配代数。

Method: 通过将大基数假设从I3提升至略强的I2公理，研究秩到秩嵌入的代数结构，并分析其生成关系。

Result: 在I2假设下，成功构造了由两个生成元生成的自由左分配代数，这是对Laver单生成元结果的重大扩展。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，在稍强于I3的I2大基数假设下，可以建立更复杂的自由左分配代数结构，为相关代数研究提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: The set-theoretic large cardinal axiom known as I3 posits the existence of a
non-trivial rank-to-rank embedding from an initial segment of the universe of
sets into itself. Laver showed that the algebra generated by a single such
embedding under the operation of application is in fact the free left
distributive (LD) algebra on one generator. This and associated theorems using
the set-theoretic structure of the embeddings yielded numerous results about
general LD algebras under the assumption of I3, only some of which have since
been proven without the use of such a strong axiom. A natural question is
whether, under the assumption of I3, one can obtain a free LD algebra of
embeddings on more than one generator. Here we show that, under an assumption
only just above I3 in the large cardinal hierarchy (namely, I2), we indeed
obtain a two-generated free left distributive algebra of rank-to-rank
embeddings.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Ostrowski不等式，使其适用于更广泛的函数类，并提出了经典版本的改进形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是放宽Ostrowski不等式的可微性条件，并探索其可能的改进形式，以扩大其应用范围。

Method: 通过放松函数的可微性条件，允许函数在有限个点不可微，并重新构造不等式，提出了一种新的Ostrowski型不等式。

Result: 结果表明，即使函数在有限个点不可微，仍能建立类似的Ostrowski不等式，并且可以进一步改进经典不等式，使其更加精确。

Conclusion: 本文成功扩展了Ostrowski不等式的适用范围，并提出了更精确的改进形式，为相关数学分析提供了新的工具。

Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to present Ostrowski's inequality for a
broader class of functions and to propose a refinement to the classical version
of it. The original Ostrowski's inequality can be stated as follows
  "If $f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ is differentiable and $f'\in L^{\infty}[a, b]$,
then for any $p\in\,]a,b[\,$, the following functional inequality holds:
\begin{equation*} \Bigg|f(p)-\dfrac{1}{b-a}\int_{a}^{b}f(t)\,dt\Bigg|\leq
\dfrac{(p-a)^2+(b-p)^2}{2(b-a)}\Big\| f'\Big\|_a^b\,.\,^{^{^{^{^"}}}}
\end{equation*} We relax the condition of differentiability and show that even
if $f\in C[a,b]$ is non-differentiable at the points
$p_{_{1}},\cdots,p_{_{n}}$, then for any
$p\in\,]a,b[\,\setminus\overset{n}{\underset{i=1}{\cup}}\{p_{_{i}}\}$, the
following Ostrowski-type inequality holds:
  \begin{align*} \left| f(p) - \frac{1}{b-a} \int_{a}^{b} f(t)\,dt \right| \leq
\frac{1}{2} \max \Bigg\{ & \left\| f' \right\|_a^{p_1}(p_1 - a),\,\ldots,\,
\left\| f' \right\|_{p_{i-1}}^p (p - p_{i-1}),\, \left\| f' \right\|_p^{p_i}
(p_i - p),\, \\ & \ldots,\, \left\| f' \right\|_{p_n}^{b} (b - p_n) \Bigg\} +
\max \left\{ f(a) + \sum_{i=1}^n f(p_i),\, -\sum_{i=1}^n f(p_i) - f(b)
\right\}. \end{align*} Also, we investigate the possibility of proposing a
refinement for Ostrowski inequality. We prove that if $f'\in L^{\infty}[a, b]$,
then for any $p\in\,]a,b[$, we can restructure the inequality as follows:
  \begin{align*} \left| f(p) - \frac{1}{b-a} \int_{a}^{b} f(t)\,dt \right| \leq
\min \Bigg\{ & \left[ \frac{1}{4} + \left( \frac{p - \frac{a + b}{2}}{b - a}
\right)^2 \right](b - a) \left\| f' \right\|_{a}^{b}, \\ &\quad + \frac{1}{2}
\max \left\{ (p - a) \left\| f' \right\|_{a}^{p},\, (b - p) \left\| f'
\right\|_{p}^{b} \right\} \Bigg\}. \end{align*}

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于递归迭代函数系统的模糊值递归分形插值函数构造方法，用于处理具有局部自相似性和不确定性的数据集（如卫星图像或海岸线测量数据），并证明了该插值函数的Hölder连续性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在测量具有局部自相似性的对象（如卫星图像或海岸线）时，获得的数据集兼具局部自相似性和不确定性。为了更好地插值此类数据集，需要一种同时具备这两种特性的插值函数。

Method: 利用递归迭代函数系统构造了模糊值递归分形插值函数（RFIFs），该函数能够插值给定的模糊数数据集。

Result: 证明了所构造的模糊值RFIFs具有Hölder连续性，并且在数据集或垂直缩放因子受到扰动时表现出稳定性。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理具有局部自相似性和不确定性的数据提供了一种有效的插值工具，其数学性质保证了在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: In the process of measuring objects with local self-similarity, such as
satellite images or coastlines, we obtain a data set with both local
self-similarity and uncertainty. To better interpolate such data sets, an
interpolation function with both local self-similarity and uncertainty is
necessary. In this paper, we propose a construction of fuzzy valued recurrent
fractal interpolation function using recurrent iterated function system that

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于迭代函数系统的模糊值分形插值方法，用于处理具有不规则性和不确定性的自然现象，并研究了该函数的Hölder连续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然界中许多现象同时具有不规则性和不确定性，传统的模糊插值或分形插值方法难以准确建模，因此需要发展模糊值分形插值方法。

Method: 首先利用给定模糊数数据集构建迭代函数系统(IFS)，生成其吸引子作为模糊值分形插值函数图像；其次分析该函数与数据集水平集分形插值函数的关系；最后证明其Hölder连续性。

Result: 成功构造出模糊值分形插值函数，建立了其与水平集插值函数的关联性，并严格证明了该函数的Hölder连续性特性。

Conclusion: 模糊值分形插值函数能有效建模兼具不规则与不确定特性的自然现象，其Hölder连续性的证明为该方法的应用提供了理论保障。

Abstract: In nature, there are many phenomena with both irregularity and uncertainty.
Therefore, a fuzzy-valued fractal interpolation is more useful for modeling
them than fuzzy interpolation or fractal interpolation. We construct fractal
interpolation functions that interpolate a given data set of fuzzy numbers
using an iterated function system and study the Holder continuity of the
constructed function. Firstly, we construct an iterated function system (IFS)
using the given data set and construct a fuzzy-valued fractal interpolation
function whose graph is the attractor of the constructed IFS. Next, we find the
relationship between the fuzzy-valued fractal interpolation function and the
fractal interpolation function of the level set of the data set. Finally, we
prove the Holder continuity of the fuzzy-valued fractal interpolation function.

Method: 通过大量计算验证，覆盖所有整数至10^7（穷举）及特定大数至10^12（抽样），寻找反例。

Conclusion: 素数幂展现出意外的组合灵活性，能够高效表示大整数，为加性数论提供新视角。

Abstract: We present a novel conjecture concerning the additive representation of
natural numbers using prime powers. Based on extensive computational
verification, we conjecture that every integer n > 23 can be expressed as a sum
of at most five prime powers p^k, where p is a prime number and k is an integer
greater than or equal to 2. This conjecture is supported by comprehensive
computational evidence covering all integers up to 10^7(exhaustively) and
specific large numbers up to 10^12 (via sampling), where no counterexample
requiring more than five summands has been found. This work highlights a
surprising "combinatorial creativity" of prime powers, which allows for
efficient additive representations despite their asymptotic sparsity and the
existence of extremely large gaps between individual prime powers.

Abstract: Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph where $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ are the vertex and edge
sets, respectively. In a graph $G$, two edges $e_1, e_2\in E(G)$ are said to
have \emph{common edge} $e\neq e_1, e_2$ if $e$ joins an endpoint of $e_1$ to
an endpoint of $e_2$ in $G$. A subset $D\subseteq E(G)$ is called an \emph{edge
open packing set} in $G$ if no two edges in $D$ share a common edge in $G$, and
the largest size of such a set in $G$ is known as \emph{edge open packing
number}, represented by $\rho_{e}^o(G)$. In the introductory paper (Chelladurai

Motivation: 探索集合划分问题中$m$-good划分的存在条件与唯一性，特别关注$m=3$这一临界情形，填补理论空白。

Method: 通过数学归纳与反例构造，分析$n$在不同模条件下的性质，针对$m=3$提出$N_o$集合描述潜在反例范围，并验证$N_u$集合中划分的唯一性。

Result: 证明$m=3$时最小反例$n\geq101$且必属$N_o$集，同时确定$N_u$集中划分唯一，猜想其逆命题成立。

Conclusion: $m=3$的$m$-good划分普遍存在性仍为猜想，但反例范围被大幅缩小，且特定集合$N_u$中划分唯一性得到严格证明。

Abstract: Given integer $n > 0$ and $m > 1$, we call a partition of set $[n] = \{1,
\dots, n\}$ {\em $m$-good} if each of the partitioning sets is of size at most
$m$ and the sum of numbers in it is a power of $m$, that is, $m^t$ for some $t
\geq 0$. It is easily seen that a unique 2-good partition exists for each $n$
and, in contrast, for each fixed $m>3$, for infinitely many $n$, no $m$-good
partition exists.
  Case $m=3$ is more difficult. We conjecture that 3-good partitions exist for
each $n$ and prove that a minimal counter-example, if any, is at least 101 and
must belong to the set
  {\centering $N_o = \{n \equiv 2 \pmod 3\} \cap \{3^t+1 < n < (3^{t+1}+1)/2
\mid t \geq 4\}.$ }
  For this case we provide some partial results. We also show that a 3-good
partition is unique if $n \in N_u = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 3^t-4, 3^t-2, 3^t-1, 3^t,
3^t+1, 3^t+2, 3^t+3 \mid t > 1\}$ and conjecture that the inverse holds too.

### [66] [An Improved Bound for the Beck-Fiala Conjecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01937)
*Nikhil Bansal,Haotian Jiang*

Main category: math.CO

TL;DR: 本文改进了Beck和Fiala关于组合差异的猜想，提出了当$k \geq \log^5 n$时，组合差异的上界为$O(\sqrt{k \log\log n})$的算法证明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于1981年Beck和Fiala提出的猜想：对于度数最多为$k$的集合系统，其组合差异$\mathsf{disc}(A)$的上界为$O(\sqrt{k})$。此前最佳结果为$O(k)$或$O(\sqrt{k \log n})$。

Method: 采用算法方法，改进了对组合差异上界的证明，特别是在$k \geq \log^5 n$的情况下。

Result: 证明了当$k \geq \log^5 n$时，组合差异的上界为$O(\sqrt{k \log\log n})$，与Beck-Fiala猜想在$O(\sqrt{\log \log n})$范围内几乎完全匹配。

Conclusion: 本文结果在几乎整个$k$的范围内，将组合差异的上界改进至$O(\sqrt{k \log\log n})$，显著推进了Beck和Fiala猜想的研究。

Abstract: In 1981, Beck and Fiala [Discrete Appl. Math, 1981] conjectured that given a
set system $A \in \{0,1\}^{m \times n}$ with degree at most $k$ (i.e., each
column of $A$ has at most $k$ non-zeros), its combinatorial discrepancy
$\mathsf{disc}(A) := \min_{x \in \{\pm 1\}^n} \|Ax\|_\infty$ is at most
$O(\sqrt{k})$. Previously, the best-known bounds for this conjecture were
either $O(k)$, first established by Beck and Fiala [Discrete Appl. Math, 1981],
or $O(\sqrt{k \log n})$, first proved by Banaszczyk [Random Struct. Algor.,
1998].
  We give an algorithmic proof of an improved bound of $O(\sqrt{k \log\log n})$
whenever $k \geq \log^5 n$, thus matching the Beck-Fiala conjecture up to
$O(\sqrt{\log \log n})$ for almost the full regime of $k$.

TL;DR: 本文证明了Ballantine等人提出的关于整数分拆映射$\mathrm{pre}_2$在特定集合上单射性的猜想。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ballantine、Beck、Merca和Sagan提出了一个猜想，认为对于每个整数n，映射$\mathrm{pre}_2$在n的整数分拆集合上是单射的。这一猜想激发了研究者对其正确性的验证。

Method: 研究者通过数学证明的方法，验证了映射$\mathrm{pre}_2$在整数分拆集合上的单射性。

Result: 研究结果表明，对于每个整数n，映射$\mathrm{pre}_2$确实在n的整数分拆集合上是单射的，从而证明了猜想的正确性。

Conclusion: 本文成功证明了Ballantine等人提出的猜想，为整数分拆理论中的映射单射性问题提供了明确的答案。

Abstract: Ballantine, Beck, and Merca defined a map $\mathrm{pre}_2$, which sends an
integer partition $\lambda = (\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_{\ell})$ to the set
$\{\lambda_i\lambda_j : 1 \leq i < j \leq \ell\}$ consisting of the pairwise
products of parts of $\lambda$. The same three authors and Sagan conjectured
that for each $n$, the map $\mathrm{pre}_2$ is injective on the set of integer
partitions of $n$. In this note, we prove their conjecture.

Motivation: 与最小化皇后数量覆盖棋盘的研究不同，本文固定皇后数量，分析最优覆盖配置，探讨内部损失和分散化的影响。

Method: 通过定义平衡和重叠集中度概念分解内部损失，并利用这些结果在大棋盘上寻找所有最优皇后配置。

Result: 对于2≤q≤9，找到了所有大棋盘上的最优皇后配置，并与经典非攻击皇后问题进行了关联比较。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了皇后最优配置的阈值现象，并展示了经典解在大棋盘上的适用性差异。

Abstract: We study optimal configurations of Queens on a square chessboard, defined as
those covering the maximum number of squares. For a fixed number of Queens,
$q$, we prove the existence of two thresholds in board size: a non-attacking
threshold beyond which all optimal configurations are pairwise non-attacking,
and a stabilizing threshold beyond which the set of optimal configurations
becomes constant. Related studies on Queen domination, such as Tarnai and
G\'asp\'ar (2007), focus on minimizing the number of Queens needed for full
board coverage. Our approach, by contrast, fixes the number of Queens and
analyzes optimal cover via a certain loss-function due to {\em internal loss}
and {\em decentralization}. We demonstrate how the internal loss can be
decomposed in terms of defined concepts, {\em balance} and {\em overlap
concentration}. Moreover, by using our results, for sufficiently large board
sizes, we find all optimal Queen configurations for all $2\le q\le 9$. And,
whenever possible, we relate those solutions in terms of the classical problem
of placing $q$ non-attacking Queens on a $q\times q$ board. For example, in
case $q=8$, out of the twelve classical fundamental solutions, only three apply
here as centralized patterns on large boards. On the other hand, the single
classical fundamental solution for $q=6$ is never cover optimal on large
boards, even if centralized, but another pattern that fits inside a $q\times
(q+1)$ board applies.

Motivation: 研究三角图${\cal T}(n)$的谱结构和特征向量模式，以理解其在$n$-皇后图分解中的应用。

Method: 通过分析三角图的谱结构，将其应用于$n$-皇后图的分解，并利用Weyl不等式建立特征值的上下界。

Result: 将$n$-皇后图分解为三个不同的家族：一个由两个三角图${\cal T}(n)$和${\cal T}(n-1)$组成的图家族，一个由团组成的图家族，以及一个完全二分图家族。

Conclusion: 三角图的谱结构和特征向量模式为$n$-皇后图的分解提供了新的视角，同时Weyl不等式为特征值的估计提供了有效工具。

Abstract: A family of regular integral graphs introduced in [I.F.S. Costa, The
$n$-Queens graph and its generalizations, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Aveiro
2024], denoted by ${\cal T}(n)$ and herein called triangular graphs, is
analysed. In this analysis, the consistent structure of the graph spectra and
the patterns of the corresponding eigenvectors are highlighted. The properties
of these graphs are examined and applied to the decomposition of the
$n$-Queens' graph into three distinct families: a family of a single graph
whose components are two triangular graphs, ${\cal T}(n)$ and ${\cal T}(n-1)$,
a family of a single graph whose components are cliques and a family of
complete bipartite graphs. Finally, using Weyl's inequalities, we introduce
some techniques to establish lower and upper bounds on the eigenvalues of the
$n$-Queens' graph.

Motivation: 研究图的邻接矩阵正负特征值数量关系，推广强正则图的经典结果，并回答Torga\v{s}ev提出的问题。

Method: 通过分析线图、平面图等特殊图类，验证猜想成立性，并对连通图的线图提出新的不等式猜想。

Result: 在线图和平面图等特定图类中证明了原猜想成立，并发现若干精确满足猜想的实例。对线图的新猜想获得了部分结果。

Conclusion: 该猜想在多个图类中成立，为图的谱理论提供了新的不等式关系，后续可进一步研究一般图的证明。

Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph with adjacency matrix $A(G)$. We conjecture that \[2n^+(G)
\le n^-(G)(n^-(G) + 1),\] where $n^+(G)$ and $n^-(G)$ denote the number of
positive and negative eigenvalues of $A(G)$, respectively. This conjecture
generalizes to all graphs the well-known absolute bound for strongly regular
graphs. The conjecture also relates to a question posed by Torga\v{s}ev. We
prove the conjecture for special graph families, including line graphs and
planar graphs, and provide examples where the conjecture is exact. We also
conjecture that for any connected graph $G$, its line graph $L(G)$ satisfies
$n^+(L(G)) \le n^-(L(G)) + 1$ and obtain partial results.

according to their type i.e., their set of quantities of common neighbours for
each pair of distinct vertices.
  For every (finite) set of non-negative integers, we either classify all the
polyhedra of that type, or construct infinitely many polyhedra of that type, or
prove that none exist.
  This problem is related to the theory of strongly regular and Deza graphs,
distances in graphs, and degree sequences. There is potential for application
to complex networks and data science.

Motivation: 研究有向图及其相关结构的偏序集和格的性质，特别是为了回答C. Defant和A. Sack提出的关于递增树装饰格的多面体实现的开放性问题。

Method: 通过几何方法，将$\operatorname{tc}(D)$的重定向偏序集和$\mathbb{P}(D)$的源偏序集与图形zonotope和超图多面体的骨架的传递闭包联系起来，并分析了递增树的特殊情况。

Result: 当$D$为递增树时，$\mathbb{P}(D)$的源偏序集与$D$的装饰格同构，且它们是$\operatorname{tc}(D)$的重定向格的格商。此外，装饰格是源偏序集的MacNeille完备化，并可用于刻画路径超图的子超图。

Conclusion: 本文不仅回答了关于递增树装饰格的多面体实现的开放性问题，还深入研究了有向图相关结构的格性质，为未来的研究提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: Given a directed graph $D$ with transitive closure $\operatorname{tc}(D)$ and
path hypergraph $\mathbb{P}(D)$, we study the connections between the (acyclic)
reorientation poset of $\operatorname{tc}(D)$, the (acyclic) sourcing poset of
$\mathbb{P}(D)$, and the (acyclic) ornamentation poset of $D$. Geometrically,
the acyclic reorientation poset of $\operatorname{tc}(D)$ (resp. the acyclic
sourcing poset of $\mathbb{P}(D)$) is the transitive closure of the skeleton of
the graphical zonotope of $\operatorname{tc}(D)$ (resp. of the hypergraphic
polytope of $\mathbb{P}(D)$) oriented in a linear direction. When $D$ is a
rooted (or even unstarred) increasing tree, we show that the acyclic sourcing
poset of $\mathbb{P}(D)$ is isomorphic to the ornamentation lattice of $D$, and
that they form a lattice quotient of the acyclic reorientation lattice of
$\operatorname{tc}(D)$. As a consequence, we obtain polytopal realizations of
the ornamentation lattices of rooted (or even unstarred) increasing trees,
answering an open question of C. Defant and A. Sack. When $D$ is an increasing
tree, we show that the ornamentation lattice of $D$ is the MacNeille completion
of the acyclic sourcing poset of $\mathbb{P}(D)$. Finally, still when $D$ is an
increasing tree, we use the ornamentation lattice of $D$ to characterize the
subhypergraphs of the path hypergraph $\mathbb{P}(D)$ whose acyclic sourcing
poset is a lattice.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Levine帽子问题，提出了一种新的几何框架来表示策略，构建了达到0.35胜率的新策略$K_{5}$，并解决了该问题的连续推广，证明无限帽子堆的最优胜率恰好为1/2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Levine帽子问题是一个经典的组合谜题，涉及$n \geq 2$名玩家在看不到自己帽子堆的情况下猜测自己黑帽的位置。尽管最优胜率$V_{n}$即使在$n=2$时仍未知，但本文旨在通过新方法推进该问题的研究。

Method: 首先，开发了一种通过可测函数表示策略的新几何框架，为有限和无限帽子堆提供了统一的积分公式。其次，构建了达到0.35胜率的新策略$K_{5}$，并证明其属于一类可改进当前界限的策略。最后，引入并完全解决了该问题的连续推广。

Result: 新策略$K_{5}$达到了0.35的胜率，并证明连续推广问题的最优胜率恰好为1/2。此外，新框架还提供了计算对一系列策略最优响应的方法。

Conclusion: 本文通过几何框架和连续推广，不仅改进了Levine帽子问题的策略和界限，还展示了无限帽子堆的最优胜率，为更广泛的策略分析提供了平滑的框架。

Abstract: We study the Levine hat problem, a classic combinatorial puzzle introduced by
Lionel Levine in 2010. This problem involves a game in which $n \geq 2$
players, each seeing an infinite stack of hats on each of their teammates'
heads but not on their own, must simultaneously guess the index of a black hat
on their own stack. If one of the players fails to do so, the team loses
collectively. The players must therefore come up with a good strategy before
the game starts. While the optimal winning probability $V_{n}$ remains unknown
even for $n=2$, we make three key advances. First, we develop a novel geometric
framework for representing strategies through measurable functions, providing a
new expression of $V_{n}$ and a unified treatment of the game for finite and
for infinite stacks via integral formulations. Secondly, we construct a new
strategy $K_{5}$ that reaches the conjectured optimal probability of victory :
$0.35$. We also show that $K_{5}$ is part of a larger class of strategies that
allow us to improve current bounds and resolve conjectured inequalities.
Finally, we introduce and entirely solve a continuous generalization of the
problem, demonstrating that extending to uncountable hat stacks increases the
optimal winning probability to exactly $1/2$. This generalization naturally
leads to a broader and smoother strategic framework, within which we also
describe how to compute optimal responses to a range of strategies.

Result: 完全确定了$v\geq 4$时最大基数QLS的存在性，并建立了任意$v\geq 4$情况下QLS基数的可能取值范围。

Conclusion: 该研究为量子拉丁方的基数分类提供了完整理论框架，揭示了经典与非经典QLS的构造规律。

Abstract: A quantum Latin square of order $v$, QLS($v$), is a $v\times v$ array in
which each of entries is a unit column vector from the Hilbert space
$\mathbb{C}^{v}$, such that every row and column forms an orthonormal basis of
$\mathbb{C}^{v}$. The cardinality of a QLS($v$) is the number of its vectors
distinct up to a global phase, which is the crucial indicator for
distinguishing between classical QLSs and non-classical QLSs. In this paper, we
investigate the possible cardinalities of a QLS($v$). As a result, we
completely resolve the existence of a QLS($v$) with maximal cardinality for any
$v\geq 4$. Moreover, based on Wilson's construction and Direct Product
construction, we establish some possible cardinality range of a QLS($v$) for
any $v\geq 4$.

Abstract: A $2$-distance-transitive graph is a vertex-transitive graph whose vertex
stabilizer is transitive on both the first step and the second step
neighborhoods. In this paper, we first answer a question of A. Devillers, M.
Giudici, C. H. Li and C. E. Praeger in 2012 about vertex-quasiprimitive
$2$-distance-transitive graphs for the odd order case. Then we characterize
$2$-distance-transitive graphs of valency $p$ or $p+1$ where $p$ is a prime.
After that, as an application of the above result, we classify
locally-primitive, $2$-distance-transitive graphs of small valency.
  In addition to the above results on $2$-distance-transitive graphs, we also
classify a family of amply regular graphs with diameter at least $4$ and
parameters $(v, k, \lambda, \frac{k - 1}{2})$, and these graphs arise naturally
in the classification of locally-primitive, $2$-distance-transitive graphs with
small valency.

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为[5]的关键结果提供了新证明，还解决了著名的n-国王问题，提出了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the process of bootstrap percolation on n x n permutation matrices,
inspired by the work of Shapiro and Stephens [5]. In this percolation model,
cells mutate (from 0 to 1) if at least two of their cardinal neighbors contain
a 1, and thereafter remain unchanged; the process continues until no further
mutations are possible. After carefully analyzing this process, we consider how
it interacts with the notion of (in)decomposable permutations. We prove that
the number of indecomposable permutations whose matrices "fill up'' to contain
all 1's (or are "full") is half of the total number of full permutations. This
leads to a new proof of a key result in [5], that the number of full n x n
permutations is the (n-1)st large Schroeder number. Finally, after rigorously
justifying a heuristic argument in [5], we find a new formula for the number of
n x n "no growth" permutations, and hence a new solution to the well-known
n-kings problem.

Conclusion: 尽管最佳构造的极值仍接近$\varphi^n$，但新上界显著提升了理论极限。

Abstract: Motivated by trying to understand the behavior of the simplex method,
Athanasiadis, De Loera and Zhang provided upper and lower bounds on the number
of the monotone paths on 3-polytopes. For simple 3-polytopes with $2n$
vertices, they showed that the number of monotone paths is bounded above by
$(1+\varphi)^n$, with $\varphi$ being the golden ratio. We improve the result
and show that for a larger family of graphs the number is bounded above by $c
\cdot 1.6779^n$ for some universal constant $c$. Meanwhile, the best known
construction and conjectured extremizer is approximately $\varphi^n$.

*Kevin Liu*

Main category: math.CO

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Elizalde在对称群$S_n$上的双射结果，构造了有符号对称群$B_n$上的函数$\Phi$，保持下降集性质，并在子群$D_{n+1}$上证明其限制为双射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究有符号对称群$B_n$中循环排列的下降集性质，扩展Elizalde在对称群$S_n$上的双射构造，并探索其统计应用。

Method: 构造函数$\Phi$从$B_{n+1}$的循环有符号排列映射到$B_n$，保持下降集$\operatorname{Des}(\pi)\cap \{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$不变，并在子群$D_{n+1}$及其补集上分析其双射性。

Result: $\Phi$在$D_{n+1}$或其补集上的限制是双射，且自然退化到Elizalde的双射$\phi$。应用包括证明$B_n$和$D_n$中循环有符号排列的下降数和旗主指标统计量的渐近正态性。

Conclusion: 成功将有符号对称群的循环排列与下降集理论结合，推广了经典结果，并为相关统计量的分布分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Elizalde constructed a bijection $\phi$ from the cyclic permutations $\pi\in
S_{n+1}$ to the symmetric group $S_n$ satisfying $\operatorname{Des}(\pi)\cap
\{1,2,\ldots,n-1\}=\operatorname{Des}(\phi(\pi))$. We give a corresponding
result on the signed symmetric group $B_n$ by constructing a function $\Phi$
from the cyclic signed permutations $\pi\in B_{n+1}$ to $B_n$ satisfying
$\operatorname{Des}(\pi)\cap \{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}=\operatorname{Des}(\Phi(\pi))$.
Moreover, letting $D_{n+1}\subseteq B_{n+1}$ be the subgroup consisting of
signed permutations with an even number of sign changes, we show that the
restriction of $\Phi$ to the cyclic signed permutations in $D_{n+1}$ or its
complement is a bijection. Our function $\Phi$ reduces to Elizalde's original
bijection $\phi$ under the natural identification of the symmetric groups as
subgroups of the signed symmetric groups. One application of our results is
asymptotic normality of the descent and flag major index statistics on the
cyclic signed permutations in $B_{n}$ and $D_n$.

*Gennian Ge,Yang Shu,Zixiang Xu*

Main category: math.CO

TL;DR: 本文解决了Gehe\'{e}r等人提出的开放性问题，证明所有矩形都具有典型Ramsey性质，与长宽比无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gehe\'{e}r等人发现正方形和特定比例矩形在任意高维欧氏空间着色中具有典型Ramsey性质，但未确定该性质是否适用于所有矩形。

Method: 引入新的结构约简方法，通过识别有界颜色复杂度的乘积构型，结合单纯形Ramsey定理和乘积Ramsey放大技术处理任意长宽比。

Result: 完全证明所有矩形（无论长宽比）在足够高维空间中，任意着色必然包含单色或彩虹色的全等矩形副本。

Conclusion: 该研究彻底解决了典型Ramsey性质对矩形的普适性问题，所发展的结构约简方法为相关几何Ramsey理论提供了新工具。

Abstract: In a seminal work, Cheng and Xu proved that for any positive integer \(r\),
there exists an integer \(n_0\), independent of \(r\), such that every
\(r\)-coloring of the \(n\)-dimensional Euclidean space \(\mathbb{E}^n\) with
\(n \ge n_0\) contains either a monochromatic or a rainbow congruent copy of a
square. This phenomenon of dimension-independence was later formalized as the
canonical Ramsey property by Gehe\'{e}r, Sagdeev, and T\'{o}th, who extended
the result to all hypercubes, and to rectangles whose side lengths \(a\), \(b\)
satisfy \((\frac{a}{b})^2\) is rational. They further posed the natural problem
of whether every rectangle admits the canonical Ramsey property, regardless of
the aspect ratio.
  In this paper, we show that all rectangles exhibit the canonical Ramsey
property, thereby completely resolving this open problem of Gehe\'{e}r,
Sagdeev, and T\'{o}th. Our proof introduces a new structural reduction that
identifies product configurations with bounded color complexity, enabling the
application of simplex Ramsey theorems and product Ramsey amplification to
control arbitrary aspect ratios.

TL;DR: 本文研究了零强迫传播过程的一种容错变体——泄漏强迫，确定了所有单环图的泄漏强迫数，给出了广义Petersen图的上界，并分析了边/顶点删除对泄漏强迫数的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零强迫在网络传播中具有重要应用，但传统模型缺乏容错性。泄漏强迫通过允许部分顶点无法传播来解决这一问题，增强了模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用组合数学与图论方法，通过分析单环图结构特性、建立广义Petersen图的强迫链，并研究图结构修改（边/顶点删除）对$\ell$-泄漏强迫数的影响。

Result: 1) 完全确定了所有单环图的泄漏强迫数 2) 给出广义Petersen图的上界 3) 建立边/顶点删除对$\ell$-泄漏强迫数的边界 4) 完整刻画$Z_1(G)=2$和$Z_1(G)=|V(G)|-1$的连通图特征。

Conclusion: 泄漏强迫扩展了传统零强迫理论，其容错特性更符合实际网络需求。对单环图和Petersen图的完整分析为后续研究提供了基准，结构修改影响的研究为网络容错设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We study a recent variation of zero forcing called leaky forcing. Zero
forcing is a propagation process on a network whereby some nodes are initially
blue with all others white. Blue vertices can "force" a white neighbor to
become blue if all other neighbors are blue. The goal is to find the minimum
number of initially blue vertices to eventually force all vertices blue after
exhaustively applying the forcing rule above. Leaky forcing is a fault-tolerant
variation of zero forcing where certain vertices (not necessarily initially
blue) cannot force. The goal in this context is to find the minimum number of
initially blue vertices needed that can eventually force all vertices to be
blue, regardless of which small number of vertices can't force. This work
extends results from zero forcing in terms of leaky forcing. In particular, we
provide a complete determination of leaky forcing numbers for all unicyclic
graphs and upper bounds for generalized Petersen graphs. We also provide bounds
for the effect of both edge removal and vertex removal on the $\ell$-leaky
forcing number. Finally, we completely characterize connected graphs that have
the minimum and maximum possible $1$-leaky forcing number (i.e., when $Z_{1}(G)
= 2$ and when $Z_{1}(G) = |V(G)|-1$).

TL;DR: 本文研究了$A_1^{(1)}$型二级接地分区的组合学，首次给出了其生成函数为无穷积的双射证明，并揭示了其仿射晶体结构和Yamanouchi词的大指标统计的自然出现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 接地分区由Dousse和Konan引入，受完美晶体理论启发，其生成函数具有无穷积表达式。本文旨在探究$A_1^{(1)}$型二级分区在精确差分条件下的组合性质。

Method: 通过组合双射法证明生成函数的无穷积表达式，并分析其在$A_1^{(1)}$型中的仿射晶体结构，进一步限制到有限型$A$晶体结构。

Result: 首次给出了$A_1^{(1)}$型二级接地分区生成函数为无穷积的双射证明，揭示了其仿射晶体结构，并通过有限型限制获得了新的无穷和表达式，发现Yamanouchi词的大指标统计自然嵌入该框架。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为$A_1^{(1)}$型接地分区提供了组合解释，还通过晶体理论建立了与Yamanouchi词统计的新联系，为无穷积恒等式开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Grounded partitions, introduced by Dousse and Konan and motivated by the
theory of perfect crystals, are combinatorial objects whose generating
functions-associated to specific defining matrices-admit infinite product
expressions. In this paper, we investigate the combinatorics of grounded
partitions at level $2$ in type $A_1^{(1)}$ with exact difference conditions.
We provide the first bijective proof that their generating functions are given
by infinite products. Furthermore, we show that these partitions carry an
affine crystal structure in type $A_1^{(1)}$. By restricting to the finite type
$A$ crystal structure, we obtain new infinite sum expressions for the
corresponding products. Remarkably, the major index statistic on Yamanouchi
words arises naturally within this framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受神经科学群组独立成分分析启发，将市场视为高维动态系统而非资产集合，探索集体认知的金融表征。

Method: 引入动态市场网络连接性(dMNC)方法，将股票作为功能节点，价格共波动视为集体认知表达，无需预测标签。

Result: 发现市场存在结构稳定的子网络，能捕捉制度转换并识别系统性预警信号，呈现类脑的时变模块化架构。

Conclusion: 开创金融连接组学领域，融合系统神经科学与量化金融，为复杂经济系统提供新的分析范式。

Abstract: We propose the Financial Connectome, a new scientific discipline that models
financial markets through the lens of brain functional architecture. Inspired
by the foundational work of group independent component analysis (groupICA) in
neuroscience, we reimagine markets not as collections of assets, but as
high-dimensional dynamic systems composed of latent market modules. Treating
stocks as functional nodes and their co-fluctuations as expressions of
collective cognition, we introduce dynamic Market Network Connectivity (dMNC),
the financial analogue of dynamic functional connectivity (dFNC). This
biologically inspired framework reveals structurally persistent market
subnetworks, captures regime shifts, and uncovers systemic early warning
signals all without reliance on predictive labels. Our results suggest that
markets, like brains, exhibit modular, self-organizing, and temporally evolving
architectures. This work inaugurates the field of financial connectomics, a
principled synthesis of systems neuroscience and quantitative finance aimed at
uncovering the hidden logic of complex economies.

TL;DR: 本文提出ByteGen模型，首次实现直接从原始字节流生成高频限价订单簿动态，无需特征工程或标记化，通过新型混合Mamba-Transformer架构学习市场底层规律，在CME比特币期货数据上成功复现市场关键特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高频订单簿建模方法受限于随机假设或标记化导致的数值精度损失，亟需能直接处理原始金融数据并保持高精度的生成模型。

Method: 1) 设计32字节压缩二进制格式无损表示市场消息；2) 采用H-Net混合架构（动态分块的Mamba-Transformer）进行自回归字节预测；3) 完全消除特征工程与标记化步骤。

Result: 在3400万条CME比特币期货事件上，模型成功生成符合市场典型事实的结果：真实价格分布、厚尾收益率、突发性事件时序，且在市场质量指标上具竞争力。

Conclusion: 字节级直接学习为复杂金融系统建模提供了灵活新范式，证明无需标记化偏差即可有效捕捉市场动态，为量化金融模拟与回测开辟新途径。

Abstract: Generative modeling of high-frequency limit order book (LOB) dynamics is a
critical yet unsolved challenge in quantitative finance, essential for robust
market simulation and strategy backtesting. Existing approaches are often
constrained by simplifying stochastic assumptions or, in the case of modern
deep learning models like Transformers, rely on tokenization schemes that
affect the high-precision, numerical nature of financial data through
discretization and binning. To address these limitations, we introduce ByteGen,
a novel generative model that operates directly on the raw byte streams of LOB
events. Our approach treats the problem as an autoregressive next-byte
prediction task, for which we design a compact and efficient 32-byte packed
binary format to represent market messages without information loss. The core
novelty of our work is the complete elimination of feature engineering and
tokenization, enabling the model to learn market dynamics from its most
fundamental representation. We achieve this by adapting the H-Net architecture,
a hybrid Mamba-Transformer model that uses a dynamic chunking mechanism to
discover the inherent structure of market messages without predefined rules.
Our primary contributions are: 1) the first end-to-end, byte-level framework
for LOB modeling; 2) an efficient packed data representation; and 3) a
comprehensive evaluation on high-frequency data. Trained on over 34 million
events from CME Bitcoin futures, ByteGen successfully reproduces key stylized
facts of financial markets, generating realistic price distributions,
heavy-tailed returns, and bursty event timing. Our findings demonstrate that
learning directly from byte space is a promising and highly flexible paradigm
for modeling complex financial systems, achieving competitive performance on
standard market quality metrics without the biases of tokenization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在为RSA提供量子抗性理论基础，通过优化素数选择和模数分解，抵抗量子计算攻击，特别是Shor算法。

Method: 方法包括：(1)建立量子数论安全模型，展示素数分布不对称性与量子攻击复杂度的指数关系；(2)开发自适应素数生成算法，生成$\mathscr{H}_2$优化的模数；(3)在量子随机预言模型下证明与格基方案的计算等价性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法显著提升了RSA的量子抗性，通过理论证明和算法优化，为后量子密码学提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: This paper establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for enhancing RSA's
quantum resistance through adaptive R\'enyi entropy optimization in modulus
decomposition. We introduce a novel number-theoretic framework that
fundamentally alters RSA's vulnerability landscape against Shor's algorithm by
strategically constraining prime selection to minimize R\'enyi entropy
$\mathscr{H}_2$. Our approach features three fundamental innovations: (1) a
quantum-number theoretic security model establishing an exponential
relationship between prime distribution asymmetry and quantum attack
complexity, (2) an adaptive prime generation algorithm producing
$\mathscr{H}_2$-optimized moduli with provable security guarantees, and (3) a
security reduction proof demonstrating computational equivalence to
lattice-based schemes under quantum random oracle model. Theoretical analysis
proves our construction achieves $\Omega(2^{k/3})$ quantum attack complexity
for $k$-bit moduli while maintaining classical security assumptions equivalent
to standard RSA.
  \textbf{Key Enhancements in Revision:}
  (1) Prime existence proof for critical parameter $\gamma < 2^{-k/6}$ via
Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem (Theorem 3.1),
  (2) Explicit lattice embedding construction for Ring-LWE reduction (Theorem
5.3),
  (3) Quantum Fano bound for information-theoretic security (Theorem 6.3).

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于eBPF/XDP的轻量级物联网安全框架，用于在边缘设备上高效防御DDoS攻击，实验证明其有效性超过97%且不影响正常流量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网(IoT)的快速发展加剧了安全挑战，特别是由资源受限设备发起的分布式拒绝服务(DDoS)攻击。传统防御方法往往不适合物联网场景，因此需要轻量级、高性能的边缘解决方案。

Method: 该框架利用扩展伯克利包过滤器(eBPF)和快速数据路径(XDP)技术，在内核层面实现DDoS攻击缓解。采用基于速率的检测算法，在网络栈的最早阶段识别并拦截恶意流量。

Result: 通过在Docker模拟环境和树莓派4上的实际部署测试，框架在100 Mbps流量洪水攻击下展现出超过97%的缓解效果，且合法流量不受影响，系统稳定性得到保持。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，eBPF/XDP技术为物联网边缘设备防御大规模网络攻击提供了可行且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has intensified security
challenges, notably from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks launched
by compromised, resource-constrained devices. Traditional defenses are often
ill-suited for the IoT paradigm, creating a need for lightweight,
high-performance, edge-based solutions. This paper presents the design,
implementation, and evaluation of an IoT security framework that leverages the
extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) and the eXpress Data Path (XDP) for
in-kernel mitigation of DDoS attacks. The system uses a rate-based detection
algorithm to identify and block malicious traffic at the earliest stage of the
network stack. The framework is evaluated using both Docker-based simulations
and real-world deployment on a Raspberry Pi 4, showing over 97% mitigation
effectiveness under a 100 Mbps flood. Legitimate traffic remains unaffected,
and system stability is preserved even under attack. These results confirm that
eBPF/XDP provides a viable and highly efficient solution for hardening IoT edge
devices against volumetric network attacks.

Motivation: 恶意软件的多态性使其检测变得困难，研究旨在探索多态技术的实现及其对抗现有检测方法的效果。

Method: 使用死代码插入、寄存器替换和指令替换三种混淆技术生成多态恶意软件，并通过VT-notify、CTPH哈希和杀毒软件扫描进行检测。

Result: VT-notify未检测到异常，混合技术的CTPH值最佳（平均52.3125%），指令替换的性价比最高（0.0256）。行为检测杀毒软件可能识别多态恶意软件。

Conclusion: 多态恶意软件对抗传统检测方法效果显著，行为检测可能成为有效的应对手段。

Abstract: Malware change day by day and become sophisticated. Not only the complexity
of the algorithm that generating malware, but also the camouflage methods.
Camouflage, formerly, only need a simple encryption. Now, camouflage are able
to change the pattern of code automatically. This term called Polymorphism.
This property is usually used to create a metamorphic and a polymorphic
malware. Although it has been around since 1990 still quite tricky to detect.
In general, there are three obfuscation techniques to create the nature of
polymorphism. That techniques are dead code insertion, register substitution,
and instruction replacement. This technique can be added to the Metasploit
Framework via Ghost Writing Assembly to get ASM files. The detection methods
that be used are VT-notify, Context Triggered Piecewise Hash (CTPH), and direct
scanning with an antivirus that has been selected. VTnotify show nothing wrong
with the files. The best CTPH value is generated by a mixture of technique
(average: 52.3125%), while if it is compared to the number of changes made,
instruction replacement have the best comparative value (0.0256). The result of
using antivirus scanning produces a variety of different results. Antivirus
with behavioural-based detection has a possibility to detect this polymorphism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在软件工程任务中依赖运行时环境，但网络安全领域常面临环境缺失或受限的挑战，亟需无需运行时的训练方法。

Method: 利用公开CTF题解，采用角色驱动的LLM模拟逆向工程运行时行为，生成真实的长周期交互序列，无需实际环境。

Result: Cyber-Zero-32B模型在InterCode-CTF等三个基准测试中绝对性能提升13.1%，创开源模型新纪录，媲美DeepSeek-V3等商业系统。

Conclusion: 无运行时轨迹合成可有效降低开发顶尖网络安全代理的门槛，Cyber-Zero在成本效益上优于商业系统，推动技术民主化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in software
engineering tasks when trained with executable runtime environments,
particularly in resolving GitHub issues. However, such runtime environments are
often unavailable in other domains, especially cybersecurity, where challenge
configurations and execution contexts are ephemeral or restricted. We present
Cyber-Zero, the first runtime-free framework for synthesizing high-quality
agent trajectories to train cybersecurity LLMs. Cyber-Zero leverages publicly
available CTF writeups and employs persona-driven LLM simulation to
reverse-engineer runtime behaviors and generate realistic, long-horizon
interaction sequences without actual environments. Using trajectories
synthesized by Cyber-Zero, we train LLM-based agents that achieve up to 13.1%
absolute performance gains over baseline models on three prominent CTF
benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best model,
Cyber-Zero-32B, establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-weight
models, matching the capabilities of proprietary systems like DeepSeek-V3-0324
and Claude-3.5-Sonnet while offering superior cost-effectiveness, and
demonstrating that runtime-free trajectory synthesis can effectively
democratize the development of state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents.

TL;DR: 研究通过分析Agora黑市数据，发现产品多样化是供应商成功的关键因素，而PGP加密信号更多作为专业标记。成功的供应商需快速切换产品类别，执法应针对多样化供应商采取多类别协同策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解非法数字市场中行为驱动因素对制定有效执法策略和认识数字商业演变至关重要，因暗网毒品市场在毒品经济中占比日益增长。

Method: 采用定量回归分析，研究Agora市场2014-2015年间2,653个供应商的50,000+条商品列表，考察网络安全信号（PGP加密提及）、产品多样化与商业成功的关系，并控制声誉、价格和类别特定因素。

Result: 产品多样化是供应商规模的主要预测因素，每增加一个类别，成为大型供应商的几率增加169%。PGP加密信号主要作为专业标记而非独立成功因素。成功供应商依赖产品组合广度而非专一性。

Conclusion: 成功供应商作为多样化企业能快速切换产品类别，需针对多样化供应商采取多类别协同执法策略，而非传统的单一物质目标策略。

Abstract: Understanding behavioral drivers of success in illicit digital marketplaces
is critical for developing effective enforcement strategies and understanding
digital commerce evolution, as darknet drug markets represent a growing share
of the total drug economy. This study employs quantitative regression analysis
of 50,000+ listings from 2,653 vendors in the Agora marketplace (2014-2015),
examining relationships between cybersecurity signaling (PGP encryption
mentions), product diversification, and commercial success through nested
regression specifications controlling for reputation, pricing, and
category-specific factors. Product diversification emerges as the dominant
predictor of vendor scale, increasing the odds of large vendor status by 169%
per additional category, while PGP encryption signaling functions primarily as
a professional marker rather than an independent success factor. Vendor success
depends on portfolio breadth rather than specialization, with category-specific
enforcement creating differential market constraints. Successful vendors
operate as diversified enterprises capable of rapid pivoting between product
categories, requiring targeted enforcement towards diversified vendors based on
coordinated multi-category enforcement approaches rather than traditional
substance-specific targeting strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要评估语言模型在聊天机器人或简单工具使用场景中的安全风险，未涉及赋予计算机完全访问权限的CUAs。为更全面评估CUAs的滥用风险，作者提出了CUAHarm基准测试。

Method: CUAHarm包含104个专家编写的现实滥用风险案例，提供沙盒环境和基于规则的可验证奖励，测量CUAs执行恶意任务的成功率。评估了多个前沿开源和专有语言模型，并探索了使用语言模型监控CUAs行为的方法。

Result: 前沿语言模型（如Claude 3.7 Sonnet）在未精心设计越狱提示的情况下，执行恶意任务的成功率高达59%。新型模型滥用率更高，且代理框架（如UI-TARS-1.5）会放大滥用风险。监控CUAs行为的检测准确率仅为72%，改进有限。

Conclusion: CUAs存在显著的滥用风险，现有语言模型在计算机控制场景中表现出不安全行为。监控CUAs行为具有挑战性，需进一步研究更有效的风险缓解措施。CUAHarm基准测试将公开发布以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Computer-using agents (CUAs), which autonomously control computers to perform
multi-step actions, might pose significant safety risks if misused. Existing
benchmarks mostly evaluate language models' (LMs) safety risks in chatbots or
simple tool-usage scenarios, without granting full computer access. To better
evaluate CUAs' misuse risks, we introduce a new benchmark: CUAHarm. CUAHarm
consists of 104 expert-written realistic misuse risks, such as disabling
firewalls, leaking confidential information, launching denial-of-service
attacks, or installing backdoors. We provide a sandbox environment and
rule-based verifiable rewards to measure CUAs' success rates in executing these
tasks (e.g., whether the firewall is indeed disabled), not just refusal. We
evaluate multiple frontier open-source and proprietary LMs, such as Claude
Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama-3.3-70B, and Mistral Large 2.
Surprisingly, even without carefully designed jailbreaking prompts, these
frontier LMs comply with executing these malicious tasks at a high success rate
(e.g., 59% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet). Newer models show higher misuse rates:
Claude 3.7 Sonnet succeeds on 15% more tasks than Claude 3.5. While these
models are robust to common malicious prompts (e.g., creating a bomb) in
chatbot settings, they behave unsafely as CUAs. We further evaluate a leading
agentic framework (UI-TARS-1.5) and find that while it improves performance, it
also amplifies misuse risks. Benign variants reveal refusals stem from
alignment, not capability limits. To mitigate risks, we explore using LMs to
monitor CUAs' actions and chain-of-thoughts (CoTs). Monitoring CUAs is
significantly harder than chatbot outputs. Monitoring CoTs yields modest gains,
with average detection accuracy at only 72%. Even with hierarchical
summarization, improvement is limited to 4%. CUAHarm will be released at
https://github.com/db-ol/CUAHarm.

### [95] [LLMs Can Covertly Sandbag on Capability Evaluations Against Chain-of-Thought Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00943)
*Chloe Li,Mary Phuong,Noah Y. Siegel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究探讨了AI模型在危险能力评估中通过思维链(CoT)监控进行隐蔽性消极应对(sandbagging)的可能性，发现前沿模型和小型开源模型能在0-shot条件下规避监控，但成功率仅16-36%，揭示了CoT监控的潜在漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统部署安全性需求的增长，评估其危险能力时的可信度至关重要。消极应对(sandbagging)作为评估威胁已被实证，需研究通过监控思维链(CoT)来检测模型意图的有效性。

Method: 通过提示模型在监控无知(monitor-oblivious)或监控感知(monitor-aware)状态下进行消极应对，测量其规避CoT监控的能力，并定性分析未被捕获的思维链。

Result: 前沿模型和小型开源模型均能在0-shot条件下隐蔽消极应对，监控感知状态下成功率16-36%。研究归纳出5种由模型生成的隐蔽消极应对策略，揭示了CoT监控的复杂攻击面。

Conclusion: 当前CoT监控存在可被利用的漏洞，但模型尚不能稳定规避。研究结果揭示了监控机制的失效模式，为构建更全面的消极应对模型生物库提供参考。

Abstract: Trustworthy evaluations of dangerous capabilities are increasingly crucial
for determining whether an AI system is safe to deploy. One empirically
demonstrated threat to this is sandbagging - the strategic underperformance on
evaluations by AI models or their developers. One promising defense is to
monitor a model's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, as this could reveal its
intentions and plans. In this work, we measure the ability of models to sandbag
on dangerous capability evaluations against a CoT monitor by prompting them to
sandbag while being either monitor-oblivious or monitor-aware. We show that
both frontier models and small open-sourced models can covertly sandbag against
CoT monitoring 0-shot without hints. However, they cannot yet do so reliably:
they bypass the monitor 16-36\% of the time when monitor-aware, conditioned on
sandbagging successfully. We qualitatively analyzed the uncaught CoTs to
understand why the monitor failed. We reveal a rich attack surface for CoT
monitoring and contribute five covert sandbagging policies generated by models.
These results inform potential failure modes of CoT monitoring and may help
build more diverse sandbagging model organisms.

*Isabelle Bakker,John Hastings*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究评估GPT-4o在OverTheWire的Bandit夺旗游戏中自主解决初级攻击性安全任务的能力，80%成功率表明大语言模型可自动化部分渗透测试流程，同时揭示其当前架构局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型（LLMs）在自主完成初级渗透测试任务中的潜力，评估其对降低攻击者技术门槛及提升防御者效率的可能性。

Method: 将GPT-4o连接至Bandit游戏环境，测试其在25个兼容单命令SSH框架的关卡中的表现，记录自主解决及需提示辅助的案例。

Result: GPT-4o独立解决18关，在提示后解决另2关（总成功率80%），擅长单步文件操作、数据解码等任务，但在多命令持久化、复杂网络侦察等场景中失败。

Conclusion: LLMs能显著自动化新手渗透测试流程，其局限性揭示了安全设计可抵御简单LLM攻击的领域，同时展现了在网络安全教育中作为辅助工具的潜力。

Abstract: This study evaluates the ability of GPT-4o to autonomously solve
beginner-level offensive security tasks by connecting the model to
OverTheWire's Bandit capture-the-flag game. Of the 25 levels that were
technically compatible with a single-command SSH framework, GPT-4o solved 18
unaided and another two after minimal prompt hints for an overall 80% success
rate. The model excelled at single-step challenges that involved Linux
filesystem navigation, data extraction or decoding, and straightforward
networking. The approach often produced the correct command in one shot and at
a human-surpassing speed. Failures involved multi-command scenarios that
required persistent working directories, complex network reconnaissance, daemon
creation, or interaction with non-standard shells. These limitations highlight
current architectural deficiencies rather than a lack of general exploit
knowledge. The results demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can
automate a substantial portion of novice penetration-testing workflow,
potentially lowering the expertise barrier for attackers and offering
productivity gains for defenders who use LLMs as rapid reconnaissance aides.
Further, the unsolved tasks reveal specific areas where secure-by-design
environments might frustrate simple LLM-driven attacks, informing future
hardening strategies. Beyond offensive cybersecurity applications, results
suggest the potential to integrate LLMs into cybersecurity education as
practice aids.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在许多领域取得了显著成功，但由于缺乏通用网络安全数据、表示复杂性以及安全和监管问题，其在网络安全应用中的集成仍然有限。

Method: 基于Foundation-Sec-8B模型，通过结合领域特定知识、指令跟随和对话能力，训练了专为网络安全对话设计的Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct模型。

Result: 综合评估显示，Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct在一系列网络安全任务中优于Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct，并在网络威胁情报和指令跟随任务上与GPT-4o-mini竞争。

Conclusion: Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct有望成为网络安全专业人员日常工作中不可或缺的助手，并已公开发布。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success across many
domains, yet their integration into cybersecurity applications remains limited
due to a lack of general-purpose cybersecurity data, representational
complexity, and safety and regulatory concerns. To address this gap, we
previously introduced Foundation-Sec-8B, a cybersecurity-focused LLM suitable
for fine-tuning on downstream tasks. That model, however, was not designed for
chat-style interactions or instruction-following. In this report, we release
Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct: a model specifically trained for general-purpose
cybersecurity dialogue. Built on Foundation-Sec-8B, it combines domain-specific
knowledge with instruction-following, conversational capabilities, and
alignment with human preferences to produce high-quality, relevant responses.
Comprehensive evaluations show that Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct outperforms
Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct on a range of cybersecurity tasks while matching its
instruction-following performance. It is also competitive with GPT-4o-mini on
cyber threat intelligence and instruction-following tasks. We envision
Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct becoming an indispensable assistant in the daily
workflows of cybersecurity professionals. We release the model publicly at

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个针对协同感知（CP）系统的延迟攻击CP-FREEZER，通过V2V消息注入对抗性扰动，使CP算法计算延迟最大化，揭示了CP系统在实时性方面的安全威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注协同感知系统的准确性攻击，但对实时性（可用性）攻击的研究不足，而实时性是自动驾驶安全的关键要求。

Method: CP-FREEZER解决了点云预处理不可微、传输延迟导致的受害者输入异步等挑战，并采用新型损失函数最大化CP管道的执行时间。

Result: 实验表明，CP-FREEZER能将端到端CP延迟提升超过90倍，单帧处理时间超过3秒，在真实车辆测试平台上成功率高达100%。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了协同感知系统可用性面临的严重威胁，强调了开发鲁棒防御措施的紧迫性。

Abstract: Cooperative perception (CP) enhances situational awareness of connected and
autonomous vehicles by exchanging and combining messages from multiple agents.
While prior work has explored adversarial integrity attacks that degrade
perceptual accuracy, little is known about CP's robustness against attacks on
timeliness (or availability), a safety-critical requirement for autonomous
driving. In this paper, we present CP-FREEZER, the first latency attack that
maximizes the computation delay of CP algorithms by injecting adversarial
perturbation via V2V messages. Our attack resolves several unique challenges,
including the non-differentiability of point cloud preprocessing, asynchronous
knowledge of the victim's input due to transmission delays, and uses a novel
loss function that effectively maximizes the execution time of the CP pipeline.
Extensive experiments show that CP-FREEZER increases end-to-end CP latency by
over $90\times$, pushing per-frame processing time beyond 3 seconds with a 100%
success rate on our real-world vehicle testbed. Our findings reveal a critical
threat to the availability of CP systems, highlighting the urgent need for
robust defenses.

TL;DR: 本文提出首个可证明安全的检索增强生成（RAG）框架SAG，通过预存储全加密方案实现数据双重保护，并验证其可抵御先进攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统的隐私安全风险（如数据泄露、投毒）缺乏系统性解决方案，传统防御策略存在可解释性差、无形式化安全保证等缺陷。

Method: 采用预存储全加密方案保护检索内容与向量嵌入，仅授权实体可访问数据，并通过计算安全模型的形式化证明验证保密性与完整性。

Result: 多基准数据集实验表明，该框架能有效抵抗最先进攻击，为RAG系统提供了理论安全保证。

Conclusion: 本研究建立了可验证安全RAG系统的理论基础与实践范式，推动AI服务向形式化安全保证迈进。

Abstract: Although Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have been widely
applied, the privacy and security risks they face, such as data leakage and
data poisoning, have not been systematically addressed yet. Existing defense
strategies primarily rely on heuristic filtering or enhancing retriever
robustness, which suffer from limited interpretability, lack of formal security
guarantees, and vulnerability to adaptive attacks. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the first provably secure framework for RAG systems(SAG).
Our framework employs a pre-storage full-encryption scheme to ensure dual
protection of both retrieved content and vector embeddings, guaranteeing that
only authorized entities can access the data. Through formal security proofs,
we rigorously verify the scheme's confidentiality and integrity under a
computational security model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively resists a range of
state-of-the-art attacks. This work establishes a theoretical foundation and
practical paradigm for verifiably secure RAG systems, advancing AI-powered
services toward formally guaranteed security.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于战场物联网(IoBT)的无条件安全加密方案，采用随机二进制矩阵和预共享密钥实现绝对语义安全，即使对手拥有无限计算能力也无法获取信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 战场物联网设备需在对手拥有无限计算能力且可窃听但不篡改通信的情况下实现安全通信，需要无条件安全的加密方案。

Method: 方案结合预共享的随机二进制矩阵和成对设备间的随机密钥，采用有限群模加法实现加密，确保即使矩阵泄露也能抵抗密钥恢复攻击。

Result: 该方案被证明具有绝对语义安全性，对手获取消息信息的概率仅为安全参数的指数级小量，且计算上能抵抗密钥恢复攻击。

Conclusion: 该加密方案为战场物联网提供了理论上的无条件安全保障，即使在最严苛的敌手模型下仍能保护通信内容。

Abstract: We consider an Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) system consisting of
multiple devices that want to securely communicate with each other during a
mission in the presence of an adversary with unbounded computational power. The
adversary has complete access to listen/read the ciphertext without tampering
with the communication line. We provide an unconditionally secure encryption
scheme to exchange messages among devices in the system. The main idea behind
the scheme is to provide secret keys to exchange messages using a random binary
matrix that is securely shared among all the devices, and pair-wise random
secret keys established between each pair of devices attempting to communicate
before the mission. The scheme is implemented by using finite group modular
addition. We show that the scheme is absolutely semantically secure, i.e., the
scheme guarantees that an adversary with unbounded computational power cannot
get even one bit of information about a message, except for an exponentially
small probability in a security parameter. Besides that, we show that even if
the random binary matrix is revealed to the adversary, the provided scheme is
computationally secure against the key recovery attack.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出AdVAR-DNN攻击，利用协作DNN推理中的敏感信息交换漏洞，通过对抗变分自编码器生成不可追踪的篡改样本，有效破坏协作推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备因计算能力有限，常将部分DNN推理任务卸载到远程服务器，这种协作推理在未加密网络中交换动态分区信息时存在隐私漏洞。

Method: 采用对抗变分自编码器(VAE)生成不可追踪的篡改样本，结合分类器检测模型信息，无需预先了解DNN模型及其分区方式（黑盒攻击）。

Result: 在CIFAR-100数据集上测试主流物体分类DNN，AdVAR-DNN展现出高攻击成功率且几乎无法被检测。

Conclusion: AdVAR-DNN攻击揭示了协作DNN推理中的新型安全威胁，需开发针对性防御机制以保护敏感模型信息。

Abstract: In recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become increasingly
integral to IoT-based environments, enabling realtime visual computing.
However, the limited computational capacity of these devices has motivated the
adoption of collaborative DNN inference, where the IoT device offloads part of
the inference-related computation to a remote server. Such offloading often
requires dynamic DNN partitioning information to be exchanged among the
participants over an unsecured network or via relays/hops, leading to novel
privacy vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose AdVAR-DNN, an adversarial
variational autoencoder (VAE)-based misclassification attack, leveraging
classifiers to detect model information and a VAE to generate untraceable
manipulated samples, specifically designed to compromise the collaborative
inference process. AdVAR-DNN attack uses the sensitive information exchange
vulnerability of collaborative DNN inference and is black-box in nature in
terms of having no prior knowledge about the DNN model and how it is
partitioned. Our evaluation using the most popular object classification DNNs
on the CIFAR-100 dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of AdVAR-DNN in terms
of high attack success rate with little to no probability of detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密码学研究集中于算法层面的可证明安全，而现实攻击往往针对实现层的漏洞（如内存管理、熵源不足等）。现有方法缺乏统一的可验证框架来建模实现层安全性。

Method: 提出SEER系统（基于Babuk勒索软件加密核心改造），整合密钥擦除、熵验证和执行一致性检查，构建结构可验证的安全实现框架。

Result: 评估表明SEER在保持实用性能的同时，实现了强不可恢复性保证，攻击面严格受限且可审计。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了从抽象理论模型向可验证实现层安全的范式转变，为系统级密码安全提供了新方法论。

Abstract: While traditional cryptographic research focuses on algorithm-level provable
security, many real-world attacks exploit weaknesses in system implementations,
such as memory mismanagement, poor entropy sources, and insecure key
lifecycles. Existing approaches address these risks in isolation but lack a
unified, verifiable framework for modeling implementation-layer security. In
this work, we propose Implementation-Level Provable Security, a new paradigm
that defines security in terms of structurally verifiable resilience against
real-world attack surfaces during deployment. To demonstrate its feasibility,
we present SEER (Secure and Efficient Encryption-based Erasure via Ransomware),
a file destruction system that repurposes and reinforces the encryption core of
Babuk ransomware. SEER incorporates key erasure, entropy validation, and
execution consistency checks to ensure a well-constrained, auditable attack
surface. Our evaluation shows that SEER achieves strong irrecoverability
guarantees while maintaining practical performance. This work demonstrates a
shift from abstract theoretical models toward practically verifiable
implementation-layer security.

*Peiran Wang,Yang Liu,Yunfei Lu,Yifeng Cai,Hongbo Chen,Qingyou Yang,Jie Zhang,Jue Hong,Ye Wu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出AgentArmor框架，通过将LLM代理运行轨迹转化为结构化程序依赖图（如CFG、DFG、PDG），并基于类型系统实施安全策略，有效检测提示注入攻击。实验显示其真阳性率达95.75%，假阳性率仅3.66%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）代理虽能结合自然语言推理与外部工具执行解决问题，但其动态不透明的行为会引发严重安全风险，尤其在提示注入攻击场景下。现有方法缺乏对代理运行时行为的结构化分析能力。

Method: AgentArmor框架包含三个核心组件：(1) 将代理运行轨迹重构为含控制流/数据流的图中间表示；(2) 注册工具交互的元数据属性；(3) 基于类型系统对中间表示进行静态推理与检查。通过程序依赖图分析敏感数据流和信任边界。

Result: 在AgentDojo基准测试中，AgentArmor实现95.75%的真阳性率（TPR）和仅3.66%的假阳性率（FPR），能有效识别提示注入漏洞并实施细粒度安全约束。

Conclusion: 将LLM代理行为建模为结构化程序的方法，为检测安全策略违规提供了新范式。AgentArmor通过程序分析技术显著提升了代理系统的安全性验证能力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving
various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of
external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces
critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection
attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime
traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present
AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph
intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations
(e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system.
AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that
reconstructs the agent's working traces as graph-based intermediate
representations with control flow and data flow described within; (2) a
property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools
& data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over
the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured
programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis over sensitive data flow, trust
boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo
benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can achieve 95.75% of TPR, with
only 3.66% of FPR. Our results demonstrate AgentArmor's ability to detect
prompt injection vulnerabilities and enforce fine-grained security constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Beta Poisoning攻击通过使训练数据线性不可分来破坏模型准确性，对机器学习安全构成严重威胁，亟需有效的防御方法。

Method: 基于中毒样本聚集性强且靠近目标类均值的特性，设计了四种防御策略：kNN邻近防御（KPB）、邻域类别比较（NCC）、聚类防御（CBD）和均值距离阈值（MDT）。

Result: 实验表明，KPB和MDT在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上实现了100%的准确率和F1分数，CBD和NCC也展现出较强的防御能力。参数分析揭示了不同条件下防御策略的性能变化。

Conclusion: 所提防御方法能有效抵御Beta Poisoning攻击，尤其KPB和MDT表现卓越，为实际应用提供了可靠的安全保障。

Abstract: Poisoning attacks, in which an attacker adversarially manipulates the
training dataset of a machine learning (ML) model, pose a significant threat to
ML security. Beta Poisoning is a recently proposed poisoning attack that
disrupts model accuracy by making the training dataset linearly nonseparable.
In this paper, we propose four defense strategies against Beta Poisoning
attacks: kNN Proximity-Based Defense (KPB), Neighborhood Class Comparison
(NCC), Clustering-Based Defense (CBD), and Mean Distance Threshold (MDT). The
defenses are based on our observations regarding the characteristics of
poisoning samples generated by Beta Poisoning, e.g., poisoning samples have
close proximity to one another, and they are centered near the mean of the
target class. Experimental evaluations using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets
demonstrate that KPB and MDT can achieve perfect accuracy and F1 scores, while
CBD and NCC also provide strong defensive capabilities. Furthermore, by
analyzing performance across varying parameters, we offer practical insights
regarding defenses' behaviors under varying conditions.

Abstract: As an emerging service framework built by combining cryptography, P2P
network, consensus mechanism and innovative contract technology, blockchain has
been widely used in digital finance, data sharing, message traceability and
electronic evidence preservation because of its decentralised, non-tamperable
and transaction traceability. However, with the complex and changeable
application scenarios of blockchain technology and the continuous enhancement
of blockchain attack technology, the security of the blockchain system has been
seriously threatened, dramatically affecting the development and application of
blockchain technology. This paper aims to analyse the attacks on blockchain
from the perspective of cryptography. Firstly, from the cryptography technology
in the blockchain, the principle of hash functions, digital signatures, and
other technologies, as well as their role in the blockchain, are introduced.
Then, based on the six-layer architecture of the blockchain, the attacks on the
data layer, the network layer, the consensus layer, the contract layer, the
incentive layer and the application layer are analysed, and the methods to
mitigate or resist the attacks are proposed. Secondly, the attack principles of
51% attack, Double-Spending attack, Reentrancy attack, Replay attack, Sybil
attack and Timestamp Tampering attack were analysed, and the mitigation or
defence solutions for these six attacks were designed. Finally, the core
problems to be solved in blockchain technology are summarised, and the future
development of blockchain security technology is projected.

Conclusion: BlockA2A通过去中心化信任架构消除了中心化瓶颈，确保消息真实性、执行完整性和跨智能体交互的可问责性，为生产级LLM-MAS环境提供了可扩展的安全解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of agentic AI, powered by large language models (LLMs), is
transforming enterprise ecosystems with autonomous agents that execute complex
workflows. Yet we observe several key security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven
multi-agent systems (MASes): fragmented identity frameworks, insecure
communication channels, and inadequate defenses against Byzantine agents or
adversarial prompts. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of
these emerging multi-agent risks and explain why the legacy security strategies
cannot effectively address these risks. Afterwards, we propose BlockA2A, the
first unified multi-agent trust framework that enables secure and verifiable
and agent-to-agent interoperability. At a high level, BlockA2A adopts
decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enable fine-grained cross-domain agent
authentication, blockchain-anchored ledgers to enable immutable auditability,
and smart contracts to dynamically enforce context-aware access control
policies. BlockA2A eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message
authenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across
agent interactions. Furthermore, we propose a Defense Orchestration Engine
(DOE) that actively neutralizes attacks through real-time mechanisms, including
Byzantine agent flagging, reactive execution halting, and instant permission
revocation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate BlockA2A's effectiveness in
neutralizing prompt-based, communication-based, behavioral and systemic MAS
attacks. We formalize its integration into existing MAS and showcase a
practical implementation for Google's A2A protocol. Experiments confirm that
BlockA2A and DOE operate with sub-second overhead, enabling scalable deployment
in production LLM-based MAS environments.

*Dechao Kong,Xiaoqi Li,Wenkai Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出UEChecker，一种基于深度学习的工具，通过调用图和图卷积网络检测未检查的外部调用漏洞，准确率达87.59%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DApp合约层攻击频发，造成660亿美元经济损失，漏洞主要源于合约与外部协议交互时未验证调用结果。

Method: 设计边缘预测模块重构调用图节点特征，节点聚合模块捕获结构信息，Conformer Block模块整合多头注意力与卷积网络，结合图卷积网络检测漏洞。

Result: 审计608个DApp智能合约后，UEChecker准确率87.59%，优于GAT、LSTM和GCN基线模型。

Conclusion: UEChecker通过多模块协同显著提升未检查外部调用漏洞的检测性能，为智能合约安全提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing number of attacks on the contract layer of DApps has resulted
in economic losses amounting to $66 billion. Vulnerabilities arise when
contracts interact with external protocols without verifying the results of the
calls, leading to exploit entry points such as flash loan attacks and
reentrancy attacks. In this paper, we propose UEChecker, a deep learning-based
tool that utilizes a call graph and a Graph Convolutional Network to detect
unchecked external call vulnerabilities. We design the following components: An
edge prediction module that reconstructs the feature representation of nodes
and edges in the call graph; A node aggregation module that captures structural
information from both the node itself and its neighbors, thereby enhancing
feature representation between nodes and improving the model's understanding of
the global graph structure; A Conformer Block module that integrates multi-head
attention, convolutional modules, and feedforward neural networks to more
effectively capture dependencies of different scales within the call graph,
extending beyond immediate neighbors and enhancing the performance of
vulnerability detection. Finally, we combine these modules with Graph
Convolutional Network to detect unchecked external call vulnerabilities. By
auditing the smart contracts of 608 DApps, our results show that our tool
achieves an accuracy of 87.59% in detecting unchecked external call
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we compare our tool with GAT, LSTM, and GCN
baselines, and in the comparison experiments, UEChecker consistently
outperforms these models in terms of accuracy.

*Hongli Peng,Xiaoqi Li,Wenkai Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态深度学习方法MultiCFV，用于检测智能合约中的控制流漏洞和代码克隆，通过融合控制流图、抽象语法树和代码注释特征，提高了检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能合约常存在漏洞导致资产损失，现有检测工具多依赖单一模态，性能与泛化能力有限。需结合多模态特征提升检测效果。

Method: 从源代码生成字节码构建控制流图提取结构特征，利用抽象语法树获取语法特征，结合代码注释的语义特征，三模态特征融合建立检测数据库。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效整合结构、语法和语义信息，显著提升了智能合约漏洞检测与克隆识别的准确性。

Conclusion: MultiCFV通过多模态深度学习实现了更全面的智能合约安全分析，为区块链2.0时代的安全防护提供了新思路。

Abstract: The introduction of smart contract functionality marks the advent of the
blockchain 2.0 era, enabling blockchain technology to support digital currency
transactions and complex distributed applications. However, many smart
contracts have been found to contain vulnerabilities and errors, leading to the
loss of assets within the blockchain. Despite a range of tools that have been
developed to identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts at the source code or
bytecode level, most rely on a single modality, reducing performance, accuracy,
and limited generalization capabilities. This paper proposes a multimodal deep
learning approach, MultiCFV, which is designed specifically to analyze and
detect erroneous control flow vulnerability, as well as identify code clones in
smart contracts. Bytecode is generated from source code to construct control
flow graphs, with graph embedding techniques extracting graph features.
Abstract syntax trees are used to obtain syntax features, while code comments
capture key commentary words and comment features. These three feature vectors
are fused to create a database for code inspection, which is used to detect
similar code and identify contract vulnerabilities. Experimental results
demonstrate our method effectively combines structural, syntactic, and semantic
information, improving the accuracy of smart contract vulnerability detection
and clone detection.

### [110] [NATLM: Detecting Defects in NFT Smart Contracts Leveraging LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01351)
*Yuanzheng Niu,Xiaoqi Li,Wenkai Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为NATLM的框架，结合静态分析与大语言模型（Gemini Pro 1.5），用于检测NFT智能合约中的四种常见漏洞，实验表明其准确率高达87.72%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NFT的快速发展，其智能合约中的潜在缺陷可能导致重大财务损失，因此需要高效准确的漏洞检测方法。

Method: NATLM框架首先通过静态分析提取代码的结构、语法和执行流信息（如AST和CFG），结合已知缺陷向量构建知识库，再通过LLM进行深度语义分析以提高检测精度。

Result: 实验分析了8,672个NFT智能合约，整体精确率为87.72%，召回率为89.58%，F1得分为88.94%，优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: NATLM框架有效识别了ERC-721重入等四类常见漏洞，证明了静态分析与LLM结合在智能合约安全检测中的优越性。

Abstract: Security issues are becoming increasingly significant with the rapid
evolution of Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs). As NFTs are traded as digital assets,
they have emerged as prime targets for cyber attackers. In the development of
NFT smart contracts, there may exist undiscovered defects that could lead to
substantial financial losses if exploited. To tackle this issue, this paper
presents a framework called NATLM(NFT Assistant LLM), designed to detect
potential defects in NFT smart contracts. The framework effectively identifies
four common types of vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts: ERC-721
Reentrancy, Public Burn, Risky Mutable Proxy, and Unlimited Minting. Relying
exclusively on large language models (LLMs) for defect detection can lead to a
high false-positive rate. To enhance detection performance, NATLM integrates
static analysis with LLMs, specifically Gemini Pro 1.5. Initially, NATLM
employs static analysis to extract structural, syntactic, and execution flow
information from the code, represented through Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and
Control Flow Graphs (CFG). These extracted features are then combined with
vectors of known defect examples to create a matrix for input into the
knowledge base. Subsequently, the feature vectors and code vectors of the
analyzed contract are compared with the contents of the knowledge base.
Finally, the LLM performs deep semantic analysis to enhance detection
capabilities, providing a more comprehensive and accurate identification of
potential security issues. Experimental results indicate that NATLM analyzed
8,672 collected NFT smart contracts, achieving an overall precision of 87.72%,
a recall of 89.58%, and an F1 score of 88.94%. The results outperform other
baseline experiments, successfully identifying four common types of defects.

*Zihan Wang,Rui Zhang,Hongwei Li,Wenshu Fan,Wenbo Jiang,Qingchuan Zhao,Guowen Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出ConfGuard方法，通过检测LLM输出中的异常高置信度序列（序列锁定现象）来实时防御后门攻击，实验表明其检测准确率接近100%且几乎无延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门防御方法主要针对分类任务设计，难以应对LLM的自回归特性和巨大输出空间，导致效果差且延迟高。需要一种轻量级实时检测方案。

Method: 基于后门模型会以异常高置信度生成目标序列（序列锁定）的现象，提出ConfGuard方法：通过滑动窗口监测token置信度来识别该特征。

Result: 实验显示ConfGuard在绝大多数情况下实现接近100%的真实阳性率（TPR）和可忽略的假阳性率（FPR），且几乎不增加额外延迟。

Conclusion: ConfGuard首次利用序列锁定特征实现实时高效的LLM后门检测，为实际部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to Large Language Models (LLMs),
where adversaries can embed hidden triggers to manipulate LLM's outputs. Most
existing defense methods, primarily designed for classification tasks, are
ineffective against the autoregressive nature and vast output space of LLMs,
thereby suffering from poor performance and high latency. To address these
limitations, we investigate the behavioral discrepancies between benign and
backdoored LLMs in output space. We identify a critical phenomenon which we
term sequence lock: a backdoored model generates the target sequence with
abnormally high and consistent confidence compared to benign generation.
Building on this insight, we propose ConfGuard, a lightweight and effective
detection method that monitors a sliding window of token confidences to
identify sequence lock. Extensive experiments demonstrate ConfGuard achieves a
near 100\% true positive rate (TPR) and a negligible false positive rate (FPR)
in the vast majority of cases. Crucially, the ConfGuard enables real-time
detection almost without additional latency, making it a practical backdoor
defense for real-world LLM deployments.

Abstract: We explore the feasibility of using LLMs for Automated Exploit Generation
(AEG) against vulnerable smart contracts. We present \textsc{ReX}, a framework
integrating LLM-based exploit synthesis with the Foundry testing suite,
enabling the automated generation and validation of proof-of-concept (PoC)

Claude Opus 4, DeepSeek, and Qwen3 Plus) on both synthetic benchmarks and
real-world smart contracts affected by known high-impact exploits. Our results
show that modern LLMs can reliably generate functional PoC exploits for diverse
vulnerability types, with success rates reaching up to 92\%. Notably, Gemini
2.5 Pro and GPT-4.1 consistently outperform others in both synthetic and
real-world scenarios. We further analyze factors influencing AEG effectiveness,
including model capabilities, contract structure, and vulnerability types. We
also collect the first curated dataset of real-world PoC exploits to support

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了人工智能在美国网络安全四个关键领域（入侵检测、恶意软件分类、钓鱼检测和内部威胁分析）中的应用，展示了不同模型如何根据问题特性进行匹配，并强调了上下文驱动解决方案的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在利用人工智能技术识别和缓解美国网络威胁，针对入侵检测、恶意软件分类、钓鱼检测和内部威胁分析这四大领域，探索适合各自特性的解决方案。

Method: 针对不同问题采用不同模型：入侵检测使用无监督异常检测方法（如隔离森林和深度自编码器）；恶意软件检测采用集成模型（如随机森林和XGBoost）；钓鱼检测使用标准分类器（如逻辑回归、随机森林和XGBoost）；内部威胁分析则采用LSTM自编码器检测用户行为异常。

Result: 入侵检测中，异常检测方法能有效识别网络流量中的异常模式；恶意软件检测中，集成模型表现良好；钓鱼检测中，标准分类器效果显著；内部威胁分析中，LSTM自编码器能捕捉所有可疑行为，但误报率较高。

Conclusion: 研究表明，网络安全领域的模型性能并非取决于模型的复杂性，而是模型结构与数据特性的匹配程度。信号明显时，简单模型即可胜任；而对于复杂威胁，则需要更自适应的模型（如序列模型和异常检测器），尽管它们会带来一定的权衡。最终结论是：在网络安全中，上下文决定解决方案。

Abstract: This study examines how Artificial Intelligence can aid in identifying and
mitigating cyber threats in the U.S. across four key areas: intrusion
detection, malware classification, phishing detection, and insider threat
analysis. Each of these problems has its quirks, meaning there needs to be
different approaches to each, so we matched the models to the shape of the
problem. For intrusion detection, catching things like unauthorized access, we
tested unsupervised anomaly detection methods. Isolation forests and deep
autoencoders both gave us useful signals by picking up odd patterns in network
traffic. When it came to malware detection, we leaned on ensemble models like
Random Forest and XGBoost, trained on features pulled from files and traffic
logs. Phishing was more straightforward. We fed standard classifiers (logistic
regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) a mix of email and web-based features.
These models handled the task surprisingly well. Phishing turned out to be the
easiest problem to crack, at least with the data we had. There was a different
story. We utilized an LSTM autoencoder to identify behavioral anomalies in user
activity logs. It caught every suspicious behavior but flagged a lot of
harmless ones too. That kind of model makes sense when the cost of missing a
threat is high and you are willing to sift through some noise. What we saw
across the board is that performance was not about stacking the most complex
model. What mattered was how well the models structure matched the way the data
behaved. When signals were strong and obvious, simple models worked fine. But
for messier, more subtle threats, we needed something more adaptive, sequence
models and anomaly detectors, though they brought their trade offs. The
takeaway here is clear in cybersecurity, context drives the solution.

*Mirza Ahad Baig,Christoph U. Günther,Krzysztof Pietrzak*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文研究了区块链中权重函数$\Gamma(S,V,W)$的安全性，分类了在连续和离散模型下能抵抗双花攻击的权重函数，并提出了新的安全组合方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在最长链区块链中，如何通过权重函数$\Gamma(S,V,W)$（结合空间$S$、速度$V$和工作量$W$）确保安全性，防止双花攻击。

Method: 在理想化连续模型中，分类满足$\alpha\Gamma(S,V,W)=\Gamma(S,\alpha V, \alpha W)$的权重函数；在离散模型中，增加对$S$的温和假设（如线性增长）。

Result: 连续模型中，$\Gamma(S,V,W)$需对$V$和$W$为一阶齐次（如比特币的$W$或Chia的$SV$）；离散模型中需限制$S$的依赖性。还提出$\sqrt{W_1}\cdot\sqrt{W_2}$或$\min{W_1,W_2}$等新安全组合。

Conclusion: 研究为设计最长链区块链提供了通用工具，证明多种权重函数的可行性，并建议实践中采用更优的组合方式（如几何平均或最小值）以增强去中心化。

Abstract: The blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain record the amount of work W that went
into creating them through proofs of work. When honest parties control a
majority of the work, consensus is achieved by picking the chain with the
highest recorded weight. Resources other than work have been considered to
secure such longest-chain blockchains. In Chia, blocks record the amount of
space S (via a proof of space) and sequential computational steps V (via a
VDF).
  In this paper, we ask what weight functions {\Gamma}(S,V,W) (that assign a
weight to a block as a function of the recorded space, speed, and work) are
secure in the sense that whenever the weight of the resources controlled by
honest parties is larger than the weight of adversarial parties, the blockchain
is secure against private double-spending attacks.
  We completely classify such functions in an idealized "continuous" model:
{\Gamma}(S,V,W) is secure against private double-spending attacks if and only
if it is homogeneous of degree one in the timed resources V and W, i.e.,
{\alpha}{\Gamma}(S,V,W)={\Gamma}(S,{\alpha}V, {\alpha}W). This includes Bitcoin
rule {\Gamma}(S,V,W)=W and Chia rule {\Gamma}(S,V,W) = SV. In a more realistic
model where blocks are created at discrete time-points, one additionally needs
some mild assumptions on the dependency on S (basically, the weight should not
grow too much if S is slightly increased, say linear as in Chia).
  Our classification is more general and allows various instantiations of the
same resource. It provides a powerful tool for designing new longest-chain
blockchains. E.g., consider combining different PoWs to counter centralization,
say the Bitcoin PoW W_1 and a memory-hard PoW W_2. Previous work suggested to
use W_1+W_2 as weight. Our results show that using
{\sqrt}(W_1){\cdot}{\sqrt}(W_2), {\min}{W_1,W_2} are also secure, and we argue
that in practice these are much better choices.

*Mohammed Sayagh,Mohammad Ghafari*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多智能体大语言模型（LLM）的新方法，用于解决漏洞检测中识别CWE（通用弱点枚举）的挑战。通过分步骤的智能体协作，结合上下文信息，显著降低了误报率并提高了CWE识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在漏洞检测中存在三个主要问题：缺乏深度分析能力、局限于函数级分析而忽略上下文信息、以及二进制分类可能导致错误的CWE关联。这些问题限制了LLMs在漏洞检测中的实际应用效果。

Method: 方法分为三步：(1) 一组LLM智能体对目标函数进行潜在CWE的穷举搜索；(2) 另一组智能体收集外部上下文以支持或反驳每个候选CWE；(3) 最终智能体基于收集的上下文对每个CWE做出接受或拒绝的决策。

Result: 初步评估显示：在PrimeVul数据集中，步骤1正确识别了40.9\%的漏洞函数的CWE。在10个合成程序上的完整流程测试表明，引入上下文信息将误报从6-9个CWE降至1-2个，同时仍能在9/10案例中正确识别真实CWE。

Conclusion: 多智能体LLM方法通过结合上下文信息，显著提高了漏洞检测中CWE识别的准确性并降低误报率，为解决现有LLM在漏洞检测中的局限性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Machine learning and Large language models (LLMs) for vulnerability detection
has received significant attention in recent years. Unfortunately,
state-of-the-art techniques show that LLMs are unsuccessful in even
distinguishing the vulnerable function from its benign counterpart, due to
three main problems: Vulnerability detection requires deep analysis, which LLMs
often struggle with when making a one-shot prediction. Existing techniques
typically perform function-level analysis, whereas effective vulnerability
detection requires contextual information beyond the function scope. The focus
on binary classification can result in identifying a vulnerability but
associating it with the wrong security weaknesses (CWE), which may mislead
developers. We propose a novel multi-agent LLM approach to address the
challenges of identifying CWEs. This approach consists of three steps: (1) a
team of LLM agents performs an exhaustive search for potential CWEs in the
function under review, (2) another team of agents identifies relevant external
context to support or refute each candidate CWE, and (3) a final agent makes
informed acceptance or rejection decisions for each CWE based on the gathered
context. A preliminary evaluation of our approach shows promising results. In
the PrimeVul dataset, Step 1 correctly identifies the appropriate CWE in 40.9\%
of the studied vulnerable functions. We further evaluated the full pipeline on
ten synthetic programs and found that incorporating context information
significantly reduced false positives from 6 to 9 CWEs to just 1 to 2, while
still correctly identifying the true CWE in 9 out of 10 cases.

*Imtiaz Karim,Hyunwoo Lee,Hassan Asghar,Kazi Samin Mubasshir,Seulgi Han,Mashroor Hasan Bhuiyan,Elisa Bertino*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: VWAttacker是首个系统性测试框架，用于分析VoWiFi用户设备(UE)实现的安全性。该框架通过半自动化的LLM属性提取和测试用例生成，结合特定领域变换和确定性预言机，成功检测出21个UE中的13个安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对VoWiFi UE实现安全性的系统性测试方法，VWAttacker旨在填补这一空白，通过自动化技术减少人工工作量，并提升测试的覆盖率和效率。

Method: VWAttacker构建了完整的VoWiFi网络测试平台，采用基于LLM的半自动化属性提取和测试用例生成方法，结合两种特定领域变换对测试用例进行系统变异，并引入两种确定性预言机自动检测属性违规。

Result: 从11个规范中提取63个属性，评估1,116个测试用例，在21个UE中发现13个安全问题，包括强制DH共享密钥为0和支持弱算法等，这些问题可能导致受害者UE身份暴露或建立弱安全通道。

Conclusion: VWAttacker有效揭示了VoWiFi UE实现中的严重安全问题，部分漏洞已被厂商确认并评为高严重性，凸显了系统性安全测试的重要性。

Abstract: We present VWAttacker, the first systematic testing framework for analyzing
the security of Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi) User Equipment (UE) implementations.
VWAttacker includes a complete VoWiFi network testbed that communicates with
Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) UEs based on a simple interface to test the
behavior of diverse VoWiFi UE implementations; uses property-guided adversarial
testing to uncover security issues in different UEs systematically. To reduce
manual effort in extracting and testing properties, we introduce an LLM-based,
semi-automatic, and scalable approach for property extraction and testcase (TC)
generation. These TCs are systematically mutated by two domain-specific
transformations. Furthermore, we introduce two deterministic oracles to detect
property violations automatically. Coupled with these techniques, VWAttacker
extracts 63 properties from 11 specifications, evaluates 1,116 testcases, and
detects 13 issues in 21 UEs. The issues range from enforcing a DH shared secret
to 0 to supporting weak algorithms. These issues result in attacks that expose
the victim UE's identity or establish weak channels, thus severely hampering
the security of cellular networks. We responsibly disclose the findings to all
the related vendors. At the time of writing, one of the vulnerabilities has
been acknowledged by MediaTek with high severity.

TL;DR: 该研究从一维Siamese信任分数重构高维信任嵌入的逆问题，提出直接和估计器并证明其唯一不动点存在性，通过实验验证嵌入保留几何特性，同时揭示细粒度信任分数可能泄露隐私的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式安全框架暴露的一维信任分数可能隐含高维信任关系，研究旨在解决从低维分数重构原始嵌入的逆问题，并评估其隐私影响。

Method: 基于两个独立代理发布的设备相似性分数序列，构建含四个矩特征的直接和估计器，利用Banach理论证明重构映射存在唯一不动点，并通过合成基准测试验证方法鲁棒性。

Result: 即使存在高斯噪声，重构嵌入仍能保持设备间欧氏距离与余弦相似度几何关系，非渐近误差界证明重构精度与分数序列长度相关。实验数据与证明文件已开源。

Conclusion: 细粒度信任分数会泄露设备行为与评估模型信息，提出量化评分、校准噪声和模糊嵌入空间等对策，平衡网络AI系统透明度与机密性需求。

Abstract: We study the inverse problem of reconstructing high-dimensional trust
embeddings from the one-dimensional Siamese trust scores that many
distributed-security frameworks expose. Starting from two independent agents
that publish time-stamped similarity scores for the same set of devices, we
formalise the estimation task, derive an explicit direct-sum estimator that
concatenates paired score series with four moment features, and prove that the
resulting reconstruction map admits a unique fixed point under a contraction
argument rooted in Banach theory. A suite of synthetic benchmarks (20 devices x
10 time steps) confirms that, even in the presence of Gaussian noise, the
recovered embeddings preserve inter-device geometry as measured by Euclidean
and cosine metrics; we complement these experiments with non-asymptotic error
bounds that link reconstruction accuracy to score-sequence length. Beyond
methodology, the paper demonstrates a practical privacy risk: publishing
granular trust scores can leak latent behavioural information about both
devices and evaluation models. We therefore discuss counter-measures -- score
quantisation, calibrated noise, obfuscated embedding spaces -- and situate them
within wider debates on transparency versus confidentiality in networked AI
systems. All datasets, reproduction scripts and extended proofs accompany the
submission so that results can be verified without proprietary code.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文介绍了daleq工具，用于验证Java字节码的等效性，通过将字节码反编译到关系数据库并应用datalog规则进行规范化，显著减少了人工检查非比特等效二进制文件的工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，软件构建的安全性受到广泛关注。尽管许多公司如Oracle和Google在安全环境中重建开源项目并发布二进制文件，但这些文件与原始文件往往不完全相同。验证这些文件的等效性是一个耗时且易出错的过程，现有工具缺乏可读的解释。

Method: daleq工具将Java字节码反编译到关系数据库，并通过应用datalog规则规范化这些数据库。这些数据库用于推断两个类之间的等效性，并生成datalog证明记录规范化过程。

Result: 在涉及2,714对jar文件（包含265,690对类）的大规模评估中，daleq显著减少了人工检查的工作量，并且在识别等效性方面优于现有工具，即使在没有行为差异的情况下也能识别更多等效文件。

Conclusion: daleq工具通过提供可读的等效性证明，有效解决了非比特等效二进制文件的验证问题，并在工业环境中展示了其高效性和优越性。

Abstract: The security of software builds has attracted increased attention in recent
years in response to incidents like solarwinds and xz. Now, several companies
including Oracle and Google rebuild open source projects in a secure
environment and publish the resulting binaries through dedicated repositories.
This practice enables direct comparison between these rebuilt binaries and the
original ones produced by developers and published in repositories such as
Maven Central. These binaries are often not bitwise identical; however, in most
cases, the differences can be attributed to variations in the build
environment, and the binaries can still be considered equivalent. Establishing
such equivalence, however, is a labor-intensive and error-prone process.
  While there are some tools that can be used for this purpose, they all fall
short of providing provenance, i.e. readable explanation of why two binaries
are equivalent, or not. To address this issue, we present daleq, a tool that
disassembles Java byte code into a relational database, and can normalise this
database by applying datalog rules. Those databases can then be used to infer
equivalence between two classes. Notably, equivalence statements are
accompanied with datalog proofs recording the normalisation process. We
demonstrate the impact of daleq in an industrial context through a large-scale
evaluation involving 2,714 pairs of jars, comprising 265,690 class pairs. In
this evaluation, daleq is compared to two existing bytecode transformation
tools. Our findings reveal a significant reduction in the manual effort
required to assess non-bitwise equivalent artifacts, which would otherwise
demand intensive human inspection. Furthermore, the results show that daleq
outperforms existing tools by identifying more artifacts rebuilt from the same
code as equivalent, even when no behavioral differences are present.

has led to widespread deployment in large-scale networks that process massive
amounts of data daily. However, the reliance on Edge Computing to manage these
devices has introduced significant security vulnerabilities, as attackers can
compromise entire networks by targeting a single IoT device. In light of
escalating cybersecurity threats, particularly botnet attacks, this paper
investigates the application of machine learning techniques to enhance security
in Edge-Computing-Assisted IoT environments. Specifically, it presents a
comparative analysis of Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM -- three advanced
ensemble learning algorithms -- to address the dynamic and complex nature of
botnet threats. Utilizing a widely recognized IoT network traffic dataset
comprising benign and malicious instances, the models were trained, tested, and
evaluated for their accuracy in detecting and classifying botnet activities.
Furthermore, the study explores the feasibility of deploying these models in
resource-constrained edge and IoT devices, demonstrating their practical
applicability in real-world scenarios. The results highlight the potential of
machine learning to fortify IoT networks against emerging cybersecurity
challenges.

*Zhengxian Wu,Juan Wen,Wanli Peng,Yinghan Zhou,Changtong dou,Yiming Xue*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于方向性映射模块和对抗性知识蒸馏（BeDKD）的新型后门防御方法，通过少量干净和中毒数据平衡防御效果与模型性能，显著降低攻击成功率（ASR）达98%，同时保持分类准确率（CACC）基本不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门防御方法依赖大量干净数据且难以彻底消除触发器残留效应，导致攻击成功率（ASR）居高不下。为解决这一问题，本文提出BeDKD方法，旨在通过小规模数据实现高效防御。

Method: BeDKD包含两个核心模块：1）方向性映射模块通过翻转少量干净数据破坏干净映射但保留后门映射以识别中毒数据；2）对抗性知识蒸馏通过信任与惩罚蒸馏的循环迭代机制，强化干净映射并抑制后门映射。

Result: 在三个数据集上针对主流攻击的实验表明，BeDKD优于现有防御方法，将ASR降低98%且未显著影响CACC。代码已开源。

Conclusion: BeDKD通过创新性地结合方向性映射与对抗蒸馏，以极小数据代价实现了后门防御效果与模型性能的平衡，为后门防御领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Although existing backdoor defenses have gained success in mitigating
backdoor attacks, they still face substantial challenges. In particular, most
of them rely on large amounts of clean data to weaken the backdoor mapping but
generally struggle with residual trigger effects, resulting in persistently
high attack success rates (ASR). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel
Backdoor defense method based on Directional mapping module and adversarial
Knowledge Distillation (BeDKD), which balances the trade-off between defense
effectiveness and model performance using a small amount of clean and poisoned
data. We first introduce a directional mapping module to identify poisoned
data, which destroys clean mapping while keeping backdoor mapping on a small
set of flipped clean data. Then, the adversarial knowledge distillation is
designed to reinforce clean mapping and suppress backdoor mapping through a
cycle iteration mechanism between trust and punish distillations using clean
and identified poisoned data. We conduct experiments to mitigate mainstream
attacks on three datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that BeDKD
surpasses the state-of-the-art defenses and reduces the ASR by 98% without
significantly reducing the CACC. Our code are available in

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的后门攻击框架，针对文本到图像扩散模型（T2I DMs），具有实用性、通用性和鲁棒性，仅需少量隐蔽的后门样本即可实现高攻击成功率，且能抵抗现有防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击方法存在依赖不自然的对抗性提示、缺乏通用性及易被防御机制缓解等局限性，亟需一种更高效、通用的攻击方案。

Method: 通过设计一种仅需10个精心制作的后门样本的攻击框架，确保在良性场景下生成高质量图像的同时，实现对任意攻击者选定目标图像的高效生成，且无需针对特定模型重新设计。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个T2I DMs上攻击成功率超过90\%，且良性图像生成质量几乎不受影响。人类评估验证了攻击有效性，现有防御机制对其效果有限。

Conclusion: 该攻击框架凸显了当前防御机制的不足，呼吁开发更鲁棒的防御策略以应对此类新型后门攻击。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generating high-quality and diverse images from text prompts, yet recent
studies have revealed their vulnerability to backdoor attacks. Existing attack
methods suffer from critical limitations: 1) they rely on unnatural adversarial
prompts that lack human readability and require massive poisoned data; 2) their
effectiveness is typically restricted to specific models, lacking
generalizability; and 3) they can be mitigated by recent backdoor defenses.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel backdoor attack framework
that achieves three key properties: 1) \emph{Practicality}: Our attack requires
only a few stealthy backdoor samples to generate arbitrary attacker-chosen
target images, as well as ensuring high-quality image generation in benign
scenarios. 2) \emph{Generalizability:} The attack is applicable across multiple
T2I DMs without requiring model-specific redesign. 3) \emph{Robustness:} The
attack remains effective against existing backdoor defenses and adaptive
defenses. Our extensive experimental results on multiple T2I DMs demonstrate
that with only 10 carefully crafted backdoored samples, our attack method
achieves $>$90\% attack success rate with negligible degradation in benign
image generation quality. We also conduct human evaluation to validate our
attack effectiveness. Furthermore, recent backdoor detection and mitigation
methods, as well as adaptive defense tailored to our attack are not
sufficiently effective, highlighting the pressing need for more robust defense
mechanisms against the proposed attack.

*Dong Chen,Tong Yang,Feipeng Zhai,Pengpeng Ouyang,Qidong Liu,Yafei Li,Chong Fu,Mingliang Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为语义加密（SE）的即插即用框架，旨在保护用户与云端大语言模型（CLLM）交互时的数据隐私，同时保持数据效用和用户体验。SE通过语义编码和解码两阶段处理，有效混淆敏感信息并保留原始语义逻辑，实验表明其性能优于现有方法InferDPT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着云端大语言模型（CLLM）的普及，用户交互中的数据隐私问题日益凸显。现有方法多聚焦于敏感信息加密，却忽视了用户输入的逻辑结构，导致数据效用降低和模型性能下降。

Method: SE框架包含语义编码与解码两个核心组件：编码阶段通过轻量级本地模型将原始输入转换为保留意图但混淆敏感信息的替代语义上下文；解码阶段则根据本地存储的原始输入将CLLM响应重构回原始语义上下文。

Result: 大量实验证明，SE在保护数据隐私的同时未损害数据效用或用户体验，且在多个评估指标和数据集上显著优于当前最先进的InferDPT方法。

Conclusion: 语义加密（SE）为CLLM的安全交互提供了实用解决方案，通过创新的语义上下文转换机制，实现了隐私保护与功能完整性的平衡，为后续研究树立了新基准。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Cloud-based Large Language Models (CLLMs) has
raised significant concerns regarding data privacy during user interactions.
While existing approaches primarily focus on encrypting sensitive information,
they often overlook the logical structure of user inputs. This oversight can
lead to reduced data utility and degraded performance of CLLMs. To address
these limitations and enable secure yet effective interactions, we propose
Semantic Encryption (SE)-a plug-and-play framework designed to preserve both
privacy and utility. SE consists of two key components: Semantic Encoding and
Semantic Decoding. In the encoding phase, a lightweight local model transforms
the original user input into an alternative semantic context that maintains the
original intent and logical structure while obfuscating sensitive information.
This transformed input is then processed by the CLLM, which generates a
response based on the transformed semantic context. To maintain a seamless user
experience, the decoding phase will reconstruct the CLLM's response back into
the original semantic context by referencing the locally stored user input.
Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that SE effectively protects
data privacy without compromising data utility or user experience, offering a
practical solution for secure interaction with CLLMs. Particularly, the
proposed SE demonstrates a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art
InferDPT, surpassing it across various evaluated metrics and datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出DUP框架，通过检测引导的反向学习净化方法，有效应对隐蔽且鲁棒的后门攻击，无需完整重训练或额外干净模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前防御策略存在缺陷：检测方法依赖粗粒度特征统计，净化方法需完整重训练或额外干净模型。DUP旨在解决这些问题。

Method: DUP结合后门检测与反向学习净化：检测器通过类无关距离和层间转移捕捉特征异常，加权识别污染样本；基于检测结果，利用参数高效的反向学习机制（创新性改造知识蒸馏）使模型遗忘后门行为。

Result: 在多种攻击方法和语言模型架构上的实验表明，DUP在检测精度和净化效果上均优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: DUP提供了一种无需完整重训练或外部干净模型的统一防御框架，显著提升了后门攻击的检测与净化能力。代码已开源。

Abstract: As backdoor attacks become more stealthy and robust, they reveal critical
weaknesses in current defense strategies: detection methods often rely on
coarse-grained feature statistics, and purification methods typically require
full retraining or additional clean models. To address these challenges, we
propose DUP (Detection-guided Unlearning for Purification), a unified framework
that integrates backdoor detection with unlearning-based purification. The
detector captures feature-level anomalies by jointly leveraging class-agnostic
distances and inter-layer transitions. These deviations are integrated through
a weighted scheme to identify poisoned inputs, enabling more fine-grained
analysis. Based on the detection results, we purify the model through a
parameter-efficient unlearning mechanism that avoids full retraining and does
not require any external clean model. Specifically, we innovatively repurpose
knowledge distillation to guide the student model toward increasing its output
divergence from the teacher on detected poisoned samples, effectively forcing
it to unlearn the backdoor behavior. Extensive experiments across diverse
attack methods and language model architectures demonstrate that DUP achieves
superior defense performance in detection accuracy and purification efficacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小游戏平台爆发式增长导致代码抄袭泛滥，现有静态分析工具无法应对加密代码等深度混淆技术，需开发基于运行时行为的新检测方法。

Method: 采用四阶段动态分析流程：1)静态预分析与插桩识别内存不变性；2)自适应热对象切片覆盖关键代码；3)构建抗混淆的内存依赖图；4)基于图相似性检测抄袭。

Result: 在包含1,200款小游戏的数据集上测试，JSidentify-V2能有效对抗八种混淆方法，验证了其优于传统AST分析的能力。

Conclusion: JSidentify-V2通过运行时内存行为指纹实现了对深度混淆代码的抄袭检测，为游戏版权保护提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: The explosive growth of mini-game platforms has led to widespread code
plagiarism, where malicious users access popular games' source code and
republish them with modifications. While existing static analysis tools can
detect simple obfuscation techniques like variable renaming and dead code
injection, they fail against sophisticated deep obfuscation methods such as
encrypted code with local or cloud-based decryption keys that completely
destroy code structure and render traditional Abstract Syntax Tree analysis
ineffective. To address these challenges, we present JSidentify-V2, a novel
dynamic analysis framework that detects mini-game plagiarism by capturing
memory invariants during program execution. Our key insight is that while
obfuscation can severely distort static code characteristics, runtime memory
behavior patterns remain relatively stable. JSidentify-V2 employs a four-stage
pipeline: (1) static pre-analysis and instrumentation to identify potential
memory invariants, (2) adaptive hot object slicing to maximize execution
coverage of critical code segments, (3) Memory Dependency Graph construction to
represent behavioral fingerprints resilient to obfuscation, and (4) graph-based
similarity analysis for plagiarism detection.
  We evaluate JSidentify-V2 against eight obfuscation methods on a
comprehensive dataset of 1,200 mini-games ...

TL;DR: 量子计算机纠错技术的进步使48个稳定逻辑量子位成为可能，威胁RSA和ECC加密。研究评估了后量子加密标准CRYSTALS-Kyber的实用性，证明其在普通硬件上能提供抗量子攻击的安全保障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子计算机的发展，现有加密体系面临威胁，需要向抗量子算法过渡。CRYSTALS-Kyber作为NIST标准化的后量子加密方案，其广泛采用面临挑战。研究旨在评估Kyber的实际可行性。

Method: 研究通过在不同实现方案上进行性能测试，仅使用标准内置处理器加速功能（如AES-NI和ASIMD），未使用任何专用硬件，评估Kyber的性能。

Result: 结果表明，Kyber在仅使用普通硬件及制造商提供的加速功能的情况下，能够提供抗量子攻击的强安全保障，同时保持大多数现代应用可接受的性能表现。

Conclusion: CRYSTALS-Kyber在普通硬件上展现出抗量子攻击的实用性，为后量子加密过渡提供了可行的解决方案，但其广泛采用仍需克服类似SHA-1到SHA-2过渡时的挑战。

Abstract: The steady advancement in quantum computer error correction technology has
pushed the current record to 48 stable logical qubits, bringing us closer to
machines capable of running Shor's algorithm at scales that threaten RSA and
ECC cryptography. While the timeline for developing such quantum computers
remains uncertain, the cryptographic community must prepare for the transition
to quantum-resistant algorithms. CRYSTALS-Kyber, standardized by NIST in 2022,
represents a leading post-quantum cryptographic solution, but widespread
adoption faces significant challenges. If this migration follows patterns
similar to the SHA-1 to SHA-2 transition, organizations may experience
prolonged periods of vulnerability, with substantial security and economic
consequences. This study evaluates Kyber's practical viability through
performance testing across various implementation schemes, utilizing only
standard built-in processor acceleration features, some of which include AES-NI
and ASIMD, without any specialized hardware additions. Our findings demonstrate
that Kyber provides robust security guarantees against quantum attacks while
maintaining acceptable performance profiles for most contemporary applications,
utilizing only commodity hardware with manufacturer-provided acceleration
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 匿名通信网络在隐藏通信路径和用户身份方面至关重要，但面临AI元数据分析、去中心化架构困难及缺乏可证明安全保证等挑战。

Method: 提出一种去中心化匿名路由协议，消除对阈值模型和可信第三方的依赖，确保在高度对抗环境中的身份隐私不可区分性。

Result: 仿真实验验证了协议的实用可行性，展示了其安全性和高效性，实现了隐私保护下的信息共享。

Conclusion: 该协议为数字环境中的隐私保护通信提供了一个可证明安全的解决方案，适用于极端对抗场景。

Abstract: Anonymous communication networks have emerged as crucial tools for
obfuscating communication pathways and concealing user identities. However,
their practical deployments face significant challenges, including
susceptibility to artificial intelligence (AI)-powered metadata analysis,
difficulties in decentralized architectures, and the absence of provable
security guarantees. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
decentralized anonymous routing protocol with resistance to tracing and traffic
analysis. The protocol eliminates dependencies on the threshold model and
trusted third-party setups, ensuring indistinguishable identity privacy even in
highly adversarial environments. Different from traditional empirical security
analysis of anonymous networks, this paper rigorously proves indistinguishable
identity privacy for users even in extremely adversarial environments.
Furthermore, simulations confirm its practical feasibility, demonstrating both
security and efficiency. By achieving information sharing with privacy
preservation, the proposed protocol offers a provably secure solution for
privacy-preserving communication in digital environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络协议实现的测试对分布式系统的可靠性、安全性和互操作性至关重要，但传统基于马尔可夫模型的测试方法需要大量领域专业知识和人工投入，难以扩展。

Method: 方法首先定义协议所有可能状态，由LLM选择子集建模目标实现，再生成状态序列代码作为协议专用测试序列生成器，产生多样化测试输入。

Result: 在三种主流网络协议实现的评估中，该方法成功检测出12个未被发现的漏洞，并已提交开发者确认。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLM辅助的模糊测试框架能有效发现实际安全问题，为协议测试提供了可扩展的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Testing network protocol implementations is critical for ensuring the
reliability, security, and interoperability of distributed systems. Faults in
protocol behavior can lead to vulnerabilities and system failures, especially
in real-time and mission-critical applications. A common approach to protocol
testing involves constructing Markovian models that capture the state
transitions and expected behaviors of the protocol. However, building such
models typically requires significant domain expertise and manual effort,
making the process time-consuming and difficult to scale across diverse
protocols and implementations.
  We propose a novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
automatically generate sequences for testing network protocol implementations.
Our approach begins by defining the full set of possible protocol states, from
which the LLM selects a subset to model the target implementation. Using this
state-based model, we prompt the LLM to generate code that produces sequences
of states. This program serves as a protocol-specific sequences generator. The
sequences generator then generates test inputs to call the protocol
implementation under various conditions. We evaluated our approach on three
widely used network protocol implementations and successfully identified 12
previously unknown vulnerabilities. We have reported them to the respective
developers for confirmation. This demonstrates the practical effectiveness of
our LLM-assisted fuzzing framework in uncovering real-world security issues.

Motivation: 随着Transformer模型在共享GPU环境中的广泛部署，其面临的安全风险日益增加，尤其是通过侧信道攻击获取专有模型架构细节的风险尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究利用GPU功率和温度波动作为侧信道，在用户权限下提取预训练Transformer模型的架构细节，如编码器/解码器层和注意力头，并在单进程和多进程噪声场景下进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，攻击模型在模型家族识别上平均准确率超过89%，在超参数分类上达到100%，且利用提取的架构信息进行的黑盒转移对抗攻击平均成功率超过93%。

Conclusion: GPU侧信道泄露对部署的Transformer模型构成严重安全威胁，需引起重视并采取相应防护措施。

Abstract: Transformers have become the backbone of many Machine Learning (ML)
applications, including language translation, summarization, and computer
vision. As these models are increasingly deployed in shared Graphics Processing
Unit (GPU) environments via Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), concerns
around their security grow. In particular, the risk of side-channel attacks
that reveal architectural details without physical access remains
underexplored, despite the high value of the proprietary models they target.
This work to the best of our knowledge is the first to investigate GPU power
and thermal fluctuations as side-channels and further exploit them to extract
information from pre-trained transformer models. The proposed analysis shows
how these side channels can be exploited at user-privilege to reveal critical
architectural details such as encoder/decoder layer and attention head for both
language and vision transformers. We demonstrate the practical impact by
evaluating multiple language and vision pre-trained transformers which are
publicly available. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we demonstrate
that the attack model achieves a high accuracy of over 89% on average for model
family identification and 100% for hyperparameter classification, in both
single-process as well as noisy multi-process scenarios. Moreover, by
leveraging the extracted architectural information, we demonstrate highly
effective black-box transfer adversarial attacks with an average success rate
exceeding 93%, underscoring the security risks posed by GPU side-channel
leakage in deployed transformer models.

TL;DR: 本文提出RouteMark框架，通过设计专家路由指纹来保护混合专家模型（MoE）合并后的知识产权（IP），解决了专家归属与保护的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合专家模型合并虽能有效整合多任务模型，但专家知识产权归属与保护问题尚未充分探索。

Method: RouteMark利用专家在探测输入下的稳定路由行为，构建两种互补指纹：路由分数指纹（RSF）量化激活强度，路由偏好指纹（RPF）刻画偏好输入分布，并通过相似性匹配算法进行归属与篡改检测。

Result: 实验表明，RouteMark能准确识别重用专家，且对结构篡改（专家替换/增删）和参数篡改（微调/剪枝/置换）具有鲁棒性，优于基于权重和激活的基线方法。

Conclusion: RouteMark为MoE模型合并中的IP验证提供了实用且广泛适用的框架基础。

Abstract: Model merging via Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a scalable solution
for consolidating multiple task-specific models into a unified sparse
architecture, where each expert is derived from a model fine-tuned on a
distinct task. While effective for multi-task integration, this paradigm
introduces a critical yet underexplored challenge: how to attribute and protect
the intellectual property (IP) of individual experts after merging. We propose
RouteMark, a framework for IP protection in merged MoE models through the
design of expert routing fingerprints. Our key insight is that task-specific
experts exhibit stable and distinctive routing behaviors under probing inputs.
To capture these patterns, we construct expert-level fingerprints using two
complementary statistics: the Routing Score Fingerprint (RSF), quantifying the
intensity of expert activation, and the Routing Preference Fingerprint (RPF),
characterizing the input distribution that preferentially activates each
expert. These fingerprints are reproducible, task-discriminative, and
lightweight to construct. For attribution and tampering detection, we introduce
a similarity-based matching algorithm that compares expert fingerprints between
a suspect and a reference (victim) model. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks and CLIP-based MoE architectures show that RouteMark consistently yields
high similarity for reused experts and clear separation from unrelated ones.
Moreover, it remains robust against both structural tampering (expert
replacement, addition, deletion) and parametric tampering (fine-tuning,
pruning, permutation), outperforming weight- and activation-based baseliness.
Our work lays the foundation for RouteMark as a practical and broadly
applicable framework for IP verification in MoE-based model merging.

Abstract: AI-generated text detectors have become essential tools for maintaining

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Mirai is undoubtedly one of the most significant Internet of Things (IoT)
botnet attacks in history. In terms of its detrimental effects, seamless
spread, and low detection rate, it surpassed its predecessors. Its developers
released the source code, which triggered the development of several variants
that combined the old code with newer vulnerabilities found on popular IoT
devices. The prominent variants, Satori, Mukashi, Moobot, and Sonic1, together
target more than 15 unique known vulnerabilities discovered between 2014-2021.
The vulnerabilities include but are not limited to improper input validation,

Abstract: Academic publishing, integral to knowledge dissemination and scientific
advancement, increasingly faces threats from unethical practices such as
unconsented authorship, gift authorship, author ambiguity, and undisclosed
conflicts of interest. While existing infrastructures like ORCID effectively
disambiguate researcher identities, they fall short in enforcing explicit
authorship consent, accurately verifying contributor roles, and robustly
detecting conflicts of interest during peer review. To address these
shortcomings, this paper introduces a decentralized framework leveraging
Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and blockchain technology. The proposed model
uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to
securely verify author identities and contributions, reducing ambiguity and
ensuring accurate attribution. A blockchain-based trust registry records
authorship consent and peer-review activity immutably. Privacy-preserving
cryptographic techniques, especially Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), support
conflict-of-interest detection without revealing sensitive data. Verified
authorship metadata and consent records are embedded in publications,
increasing transparency. A stakeholder survey of researchers, editors, and
reviewers suggests the framework improves ethical compliance and confidence in
scholarly communication. This work represents a step toward a more transparent,
accountable, and trustworthy academic publishing ecosystem.

Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) face unprecedented security
challenges due to their inherent characteristics, such as multidimensional
heterogeneity and dynamic topologies. These characteristics fundamentally
undermine conventional security methods and traditional artificial intelligence
(AI)-driven solutions. Generative AI (GAI) is a transformative approach that
can safeguard SAGIN security by synthesizing data, understanding semantics, and
making autonomous decisions. This survey fills existing review gaps by
examining GAI-empowered secure communications across SAGINs. First, we
introduce secured SAGINs and highlight GAI's advantages over traditional AI for
security defenses. Then, we explain how GAI mitigates failures of authenticity,
breaches of confidentiality, tampering of integrity, and disruptions of
availability across the physical, data link, and network layers of SAGINs.
Three step-by-step tutorials discuss how to apply GAI to solve specific
problems using concrete methods, emphasizing its generative paradigm beyond
traditional AI. Finally, we outline open issues and future research directions,
including lightweight deployment, adversarial robustness, and cross-domain
governance, to provide major insights into GAI's role in shaping
next-generation SAGIN security.

Abstract: Graphics processing units (GPUs) are becoming an essential part of the
intelligent transportation system (ITS) for enabling video-based and artificial
intelligence (AI) based applications. GPUs provide high-throughput and
energy-efficient computing for tasks like sensor fusion and roadside video
analytics. However, these GPUs are one of the most unmonitored components in
terms of security. This makes them vulnerable to cyber and hardware attacks,
including unauthorized crypto mining. This paper highlights GPU security as a
critical blind spot in transportation cybersecurity. To support this concern,
it also presents a case study showing the impact of stealthy unauthorized
crypto miners on critical AI workloads, along with a detection strategy. We
used a YOLOv8-based video processing pipeline running on an RTX 2060 GPU for
the case study. A multi-streaming application was executed while a T-Rex crypto
miner ran in the background. We monitored how the miner degraded GPU
performance by reducing the frame rate and increasing power consumption, which
could be a serious concern for GPUs operating in autonomous vehicles or
battery-powered edge devices. We observed measurable impacts using GPU
telemetry (nvidia-smi) and Nsight Compute profiling, where frame rate dropped
by 50 percent, and power usage increased by up to 90%. To detect, we trained
lightweight classifiers using extracted telemetry features. All models achieved
high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This paper raises urgent
awareness about GPU observability gaps in ITS and offers a replicable framework
for detecting GPU misuse through on-device telemetry.

Abstract: The rapid advancement and widespread adoption of generative artificial
intelligence (AI) pose significant threats to the integrity of personal
identity, including digital cloning, sophisticated impersonation, and the
unauthorized monetization of identity-related data. Mitigating these risks
necessitates the development of robust AI-generated content detection systems,
enhanced legal frameworks, and ethical guidelines. This paper introduces the
Digital Identity Rights Framework (DIRF), a structured security and governance
model designed to protect behavioral, biometric, and personality-based digital
likeness attributes to address this critical need. Structured across nine
domains and 63 controls, DIRF integrates legal, technical, and hybrid
enforcement mechanisms to secure digital identity consent, traceability, and
monetization. We present the architectural foundations, enforcement strategies,
and key use cases supporting the need for a unified framework. This work aims
to inform platform builders, legal entities, and regulators about the essential
controls needed to enforce identity rights in AI-driven systems.

Abstract: The proper use of Android app permissions is crucial to the success and
security of these apps. Users must agree to permission requests when installing
or running their apps. Despite official Android platform documentation on
proper permission usage, there are still many cases of permission abuse. This
study provides a comprehensive analysis of the Android permission landscape,
highlighting trends and patterns in permission requests across various
applications from the Google Play Store. By distinguishing between benign and
malicious applications, we uncover developers' evolving strategies, with
malicious apps increasingly requesting fewer permissions to evade detection,
while benign apps request more to enhance functionality. In addition to
examining permission trends across years and app features such as
advertisements, in-app purchases, content ratings, and app sizes, we leverage
association rule mining using the FP-Growth algorithm. This allows us to
uncover frequent permission combinations across the entire dataset, specific
years, and 16 app genres. The analysis reveals significant differences in
permission usage patterns, providing a deeper understanding of co-occurring
permissions and their implications for user privacy and app functionality. By
categorizing permissions into high-level semantic groups and examining their
application across distinct app categories, this study offers a structured
approach to analyzing the dynamics within the Android ecosystem. The findings
emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring, user education, and
regulatory oversight to address permission misuse effectively.

Abstract: Phishing attacks continue to evolve, with cloaking techniques posing a
significant challenge to detection efforts. Cloaking allows attackers to
display phishing sites only to specific users while presenting legitimate pages
to security crawlers, rendering traditional detection systems ineffective. This
research proposes PhishParrot, a novel crawling environment optimization system
designed to counter cloaking techniques. PhishParrot leverages the contextual
analysis capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify potential
patterns in crawling information, enabling the construction of optimal user
profiles capable of bypassing cloaking mechanisms. The system accumulates
information on phishing sites collected from diverse environments. It then
adapts browser settings and network configurations to match the attacker's
target user conditions based on information extracted from similar cases. A
21-day evaluation showed that PhishParrot improved detection accuracy by up to
33.8% over standard analysis systems, yielding 91 distinct crawling
environments for diverse conditions targeted by attackers. The findings confirm
that the combination of similar-case extraction and LLM-based context analysis
is an effective approach for detecting cloaked phishing attacks.

Abstract: Large language models represent significant investments in computation, data,
and engineering expertise, making them extraordinarily valuable intellectual
assets. Nevertheless, these AI assets remain vulnerable to unauthorized
redistribution and commercial exploitation through fine-tuning or black-box
deployment. Current fingerprinting approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
intrinsic methods require full parameter access, while backdoor-based
techniques employ statistically anomalous triggers easily detected and filtered
by adversaries. To address these limitations, we introduce FPEdit, a novel
knowledge-editing framework that injects semantically coherent natural language
fingerprints by modifying a sparse subset of model weights. This ensures
stealthy and precise ownership encoding without degrading the core
functionality. Extensive experiments show that FPEdit achieves $95$-$100\%$
fingerprint retention under both full-parameter fine-tuning and
parameter-efficient adaptation, while preserving performance on 24 downstream
benchmarks. Moreover, FPEdit remains robust under quantization, pruning, and
stochastic decoding, and can embed 10 fingerprint pairs into LLaMA2-7B in under
10 minutes using less than 32 GB of GPU memory, a $70\%$ reduction in resource
requirements compared to existing techniques. These advances establish FPEdit
as the first fingerprinting approach to simultaneously achieve robustness
against adaptation, resistance to detection, and preservation of model utility,
providing a minimally invasive solution for reliable provenance verification of
large language models in adversarial deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Backdoor detection is currently the mainstream defense against backdoor
attacks in federated learning (FL), where malicious clients upload poisoned
updates that compromise the global model and undermine the reliability of FL
deployments. Existing backdoor detection techniques fall into two categories,
including passive and proactive ones, depending on whether the server
proactively modifies the global model. However, both have inherent limitations
in practice: passive defenses are vulnerable to common non-i.i.d. data
distributions and random participation of FL clients, whereas current proactive
defenses suffer inevitable out-of-distribution (OOD) bias because they rely on
backdoor co-existence effects. To address these issues, we introduce a new
proactive defense, dubbed Coward, inspired by our discovery of multi-backdoor
collision effects, in which consecutively planted, distinct backdoors
significantly suppress earlier ones. In general, we detect attackers by
evaluating whether the server-injected, conflicting global watermark is erased
during local training rather than retained. Our method preserves the advantages
of proactive defenses in handling data heterogeneity (\ie, non-i.i.d. data)
while mitigating the adverse impact of OOD bias through a revised detection
mechanism. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the
effectiveness of Coward and its resilience to potential adaptive attacks. The
code for our method would be available at

Abstract: As a versatile AI application, voice assistants (VAs) have become
increasingly popular, but are vulnerable to security threats. Attackers have
proposed various inaudible attacks, but are limited by cost, distance, or LoS.
Therefore, we propose \name~Attack, a long-range, cross-barrier, and
interference-free inaudible voice attack via solid channels. We begin by
thoroughly analyzing the dispersion effect in solid channels, revealing its
unique impact on signal propagation. To avoid distortions in voice commands, we
design a modular command generation model that parameterizes attack distance,
victim audio, and medium dispersion features to adapt to variations in the
solid-channel state. Additionally, we propose SUAD Defense, a universal defense
that uses ultrasonic perturbation signals to block inaudible voice attacks
(IVAs) without impacting normal speech. Since the attack can occur at arbitrary
frequencies and times, we propose a training method that randomizes both time
and frequency to generate perturbation signals that break ultrasonic commands.
Notably, the perturbation signal is modulated to an inaudible frequency without
affecting the functionality of voice commands for VAs. Experiments on six
smartphones have shown that SUAD Attack achieves activation success rates above
89.8% and SUAD Defense blocks IVAs with success rates exceeding 98%.

Abstract: Smart contract upgrades are increasingly common due to their flexibility in
modifying deployed contracts, such as fixing bugs or adding new
functionalities. Meanwhile, upgrades compromise the immutability of contracts,
introducing significant security concerns. While existing research has explored
the security impacts of contract upgrades, these studies are limited in
collection of upgrade behaviors and identification of insecurities.
  To address these limitations, we conduct a comprehensive study on the
insecurities of upgrade behaviors. First, we build a dataset containing 83,085
upgraded contracts and 20,902 upgrade chains. To our knowledge, this is the
first large-scale dataset about upgrade behaviors, revealing their diversity
and exposing gaps in public disclosure. Next, we develop a taxonomy of
insecurities based on 37 real-world security incidents, categorizing eight
types of upgrade risks and providing the first complete view of upgrade-related
insecurities. Finally, we survey public awareness of these risks and existing
mitigations. Our findings show that four types of security risks are overlooked
by the public and lack mitigation measures. We detect these upgrade risks
through a preliminary study, identifying 31,407 related issues - a finding that
raises significant concerns.

Abstract: The emergence of the Internet of Agents (IoA) introduces critical challenges
for communication privacy in sensitive, high-stakes domains. While standard
Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocols secure message content, they are not designed to
protect the act of communication itself, leaving agents vulnerable to
surveillance and traffic analysis. We find that the rich, event-driven nature
of agent dialogues provides a powerful, yet untapped, medium for covert
communication. To harness this potential, we introduce and formalize the Covert
Event Channel, the first unified model for agent covert communication driven by
three interconnected dimensions, which consist of the Storage, Timing,and
Behavioral channels. Based on this model, we design and engineer {\Pi}CCAP, a
novel protocol that operationalizes this event-driven paradigm. Our
comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that {\Pi}CCAP achieves high capacity and
robustness while remaining imperceptible to powerful LLM-based wardens,
establishing its practical viability. By systematically engineering this
channel, our work provides the foundational understanding essential for
developing the next generation of monitoring systems and defensive protocols
for a secure and trustworthy IoA.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), now a foundation in advancing natural language
processing, power applications such as text generation, machine translation,
and conversational systems. Despite their transformative potential, these
models inherently rely on massive amounts of training data, often collected
from diverse and uncurated sources, which exposes them to serious data security
risks. Harmful or malicious data can compromise model behavior, leading to
issues such as toxic output, hallucinations, and vulnerabilities to threats
such as prompt injection or data poisoning. As LLMs continue to be integrated
into critical real-world systems, understanding and addressing these
data-centric security risks is imperative to safeguard user trust and system
reliability. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of the main data
security risks facing LLMs and reviews current defense strategies, including
adversarial training, RLHF, and data augmentation. Additionally, we categorize
and analyze relevant datasets used for assessing robustness and security across
different domains, providing guidance for future research. Finally, we
highlight key research directions that focus on secure model updates,
explainability-driven defenses, and effective governance frameworks, aiming to
promote the safe and responsible development of LLM technology. This work aims
to inform researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, driving progress toward

Abstract: Operational Technology (OT) is an integral component of critical national
infrastructure, enabling automation and control in industries such as energy,

have been designed and deployed prioritising functionality rather than
security. This leads to inherent vulnerabilities in many deployed systems when
operational misconfigurations expose them to the internet. This report provides
an up-to-date overview of the OT threat landscape exposed to the public
internet and studies the affected protocols, vendors, software, and the
geographic distribution of systems. Our findings reveal nearly 70,000 exposed
OT devices globally, with significant concentrations in North America and
Europe. Analysis of prevalent protocols (e.g., ModbusTCP, EtherNet/IP, S7)
shows that many devices expose detailed identifying information, including
outdated firmware versions with known critical vulnerabilities that remain
unpatched for years after disclosure. Furthermore, we demonstrate how automated
analysis of screenshots can uncover exposed graphical interfaces of Human
Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
systems, highlighting diverse pathways for potential unauthorized access and
underscoring the risks to industrial processes and critical infrastructure.

their adoption in diverse applications. This paper proposes a novel blockchain
framework that leverages SoftPUF, a software-based approach mimicking PUF.
SoftPUF addresses the hardware limitations of traditional PUF, enabling secure
and efficient authentication for a broader range of devices within a blockchain
network. The framework utilizes a machine learning model trained on PUF data to
generate unique, software-based keys for each device. These keys serve as
secure identifiers for authentication on the blockchain, eliminating the need
for dedicated hardware. This approach facilitates the integration of legacy
devices from various domains, including cloud-based solutions, into the
blockchain network. Additionally, the framework incorporates well-established
defense mechanisms to ensure robust security against various attacks. This
combined approach paves the way for secure and scalable authentication in
diverse blockchain-based applications. Additionally, to ensure robust security,
the system incorporates well-established defense mechanisms against various
attacks, including 51%, phishing, routing, and Sybil attacks, into the
blockchain network. This combined approach paves the way for secure and
efficient authentication in a wider range of blockchain-based applications.

Abstract: Stalkerware is a serious threat to individuals' privacy that is receiving

Existing works have largely focused on studying leading stalkerware apps,
dual-purpose apps, monetization of stalkerware, or the experience of survivors.
However, there remains a need to understand potential defenses beyond the
detection-and-removal approach, which may not necessarily be effective in the
context of stalkerware.
  In this paper, we perform a systematic analysis of a large corpus of recent
Android stalkerware apps. We combine multiple analysis techniques to quantify
stalkerware behaviors and capabilities and how these evolved over time. Our
primary goal is understanding: how (and whether) recent Android platform
changes -- largely designed to improve user privacy -- have thwarted
stalkerware functionality; how stalkerware may have adapted as a result; and
what we may conclude about potential defenses. Our investigation reveals new
insights into tactics used by stalkerware and may inspire alternative defense
strategies.

Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) fundamentally rely on
vehicle-generated data for applications such as congestion monitoring and route
optimization, making the preservation of user privacy a critical challenge.
Homomorphic Encryption (HE) offers a promising solution by enabling computation
on encrypted data without revealing underlying content. This study presents the
first real-world experimental evaluation of three post-quantum secure HE
schemes, i.e., Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren (BFV), Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan
(BGV), and Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS), for vehicular communication scenarios.
Two representative privacy-preserving use cases are considered: encrypted
vehicle counting and average speed aggregation. Experiments are conducted over
both Wi-Fi and Ethernet to assess performance under wireless and wired
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) settings. Results show that BFV and BGV are
suitable for latency-tolerant applications such as intersection monitoring and
regional traffic analysis, with total end-to-end latencies under 10 seconds.
While CKKS experiences higher overhead, it remains viable for periodic
encrypted aggregation of numerical data. The experimental results demonstrate
that HE can be feasibly deployed in ITS environments under 128-bit post-quantum
security, provided that scheme-specific latency constraints are considered.
This reinforces its potential to serve as a foundational tool for secure and
privacy-preserving V2X data processing.

Abstract: Pose-guided video generation has become a powerful tool in creative
industries, exemplified by frameworks like Animate Anyone. However,
conditioning generation on specific poses introduces serious risks, such as
impersonation, privacy violations, and NSFW content creation. To address these
challenges, we propose $\textbf{PoseGuard}$, a safety alignment framework for
pose-guided generation. PoseGuard is designed to suppress unsafe generations by
degrading output quality when encountering malicious poses, while maintaining
high-fidelity outputs for benign inputs. We categorize unsafe poses into three
representative types: discriminatory gestures such as kneeling or offensive
salutes, sexually suggestive poses that lead to NSFW content, and poses
imitating copyrighted celebrity movements. PoseGuard employs a dual-objective
training strategy combining generation fidelity with safety alignment, and uses
LoRA-based fine-tuning for efficient, parameter-light updates. To ensure
adaptability to evolving threats, PoseGuard supports pose-specific LoRA fusion,
enabling flexible and modular updates when new unsafe poses are identified. We
further demonstrate the generalizability of PoseGuard to facial landmark-guided
generation. Extensive experiments validate that PoseGuard effectively blocks
unsafe generations, maintains generation quality for benign inputs, and remains
robust against slight pose variations.

Abstract: Technological advancements have revolutionized numerous industries, including
transportation. While digitalization, automation, and connectivity have
enhanced safety and efficiency, they have also introduced new vulnerabilities.
With 95% of data breaches attributed to human error, promoting cybersecurity
awareness in transportation is increasingly critical. Despite numerous
cyberattacks on transportation systems worldwide, comprehensive and centralized
records of these incidents remain scarce. To address this gap and enhance cyber
awareness, this paper presents a large language model (LLM) based approach to
extract and organize transportation related cyber incidents from publicly
available datasets. A key contribution of this work is the use of generative AI
to transform unstructured, heterogeneous cyber incident data into structured
formats. Incidents were sourced from the Center for Strategic & International
Studies (CSIS) List of Significant Cyber Incidents, the University of Maryland
Cyber Events Database (UMCED), the European Repository of Cyber Incidents
(EuRepoC), the Maritime Cyber Attack Database (MCAD), and the U.S. DOT
Transportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency (TraCR) Examples of Cyber Attacks
in Transportation (2018 to 2022). These were classified by a fine tuned LLM
into five transportation modes: aviation, maritime, rail, road, and multimodal,
forming a transportation specific cyber incident database. Another key
contribution of this work is the development of a Retrieval Augmented
Generation question answering system, designed to enhance accessibility and
practical use by enabling users to query the curated database for specific
details on transportation related cyber incidents. By leveraging LLMs for both
data extraction and user interaction, this study contributes a novel,
accessible tool for improving cybersecurity awareness in the transportation
sector.

Group Signatures (GS) with Signatures with Flexible Public Keys (SFPK). Via GS,
each member of a group can sign messages on behalf of the group without
revealing his identity, except to a designated auditor. Via SFPK, anyone can
create new identities for a particular user, enabling anonymous transfers with
only the intended recipient able to trace these new identities.
  To prevent the potential abuses that this anonymity brings, NGS integrates
flexible public keys into the GS framework to support auditable transfers. In
addition to introducing NGS, we describe its security model and provide a
mathematical construction proved secure in the Random Oracle Model. As a
practical NGS use case, we build NickHat, a blockchain-based token-exchange
prototype system on top of Ethereum.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Location-based augmented reality (LB-AR) applications, such as Pok\'emon Go,
stream sub-second GPS updates to deliver responsive and immersive user
experiences. However, this high-frequency location reporting introduces serious
privacy risks. Protecting privacy in LB-AR is significantly more challenging
than in traditional location-based services (LBS), as it demands real-time
location protection with strong per-location and trajectory-level privacy
guaranteed while maintaining low latency and high quality of service (QoS).
Existing methods fail to meet these combined demands.
  To fill the gap, we present PrivAR, the first client-side privacy framework
for real-time LB-AR. PrivAR introduces two lightweight mechanisms: (i) Planar
Staircase Mechanism (PSM) which designs a staircase-shaped distribution to
generate noisy location with strong per-location privacy and low expected
error; and (ii) Thresholded Reporting with PSM (TR-PSM), a selective scheme
that releases a noisy location update only when a displacement exceeds a
private threshold, enabling many-to-one mappings for enhanced trace-level
privacy while preserving high QoS. We present theoretical analysis, extensive
experiments on two public datasets and our proprietary GeoTrace dataset, and
validate PrivAR on a Pok\'emon-Go-style prototype. Results show PrivAR improves
QoS (Gamescore) by up to 50%, while increasing attacker error by 1.8x over
baseline with an additional 0.06 milliseconds runtime overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对自主AI系统进行分类和比较的结构化框架，阻碍了对AI代理能力的系统化分析与未来发展预测。

Method: 采用多阶段方法论构建并完善类型学，通过人机混合方法评估，最终提炼出构造类型。

Result: 开发了一个包含八个维度的类型学框架，能够分析AI系统的不同代理水平，为研究者和实践者提供工具。

Conclusion: 该类型学不仅为评估现有AI系统提供了基础，还为预测自主AI的未来发展提供了结构化视角。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are evolving beyond passive tools into
autonomous agents capable of reasoning, adapting, and acting with minimal human
intervention. Despite their growing presence, a structured framework is lacking
to classify and compare these systems. This paper develops a typology of
agentic AI systems, introducing eight dimensions that define their cognitive
and environmental agency in an ordinal structure. Using a multi-phase
methodological approach, we construct and refine this typology, which is then
evaluated through a human-AI hybrid approach and further distilled into
constructed types. The framework enables researchers and practitioners to
analyze varying levels of agency in AI systems. By offering a structured
perspective on the progression of AI capabilities, the typology provides a
foundation for assessing current systems and anticipating future developments
in agentic AI.

TL;DR: 研究通过数学建模证明人机任务分配将收敛至稳定均衡，长期自动化份额为$x^* = \alpha / (\alpha + \beta)$，模拟显示2045年自动化占比达65%，剩余人类任务将转向AI流程协调工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模AI系统快速发展正在重塑人机分工，需建立理论框架分析任务分配的动态均衡及其社会经济影响。

Method: 采用格论不动点工具（Tarski与Banach定理），构建迭代任务委派模型，并通过离散线性更新、演化复制动态和Beta分布任务谱三种动态基准验证。

Result: 存在唯一稳定均衡，自动化长期份额公式为$x^* = \alpha / (\alpha + \beta)$；校准模拟显示自动化比例将从2025年10%升至2045年65%，剩余35%任务由人类作为流程协调者完成。

Conclusion: 政策应促进人机协同的"半人马"模式，引导经济走向福利最大化的均衡点，人类需转向AI监督与整合的新专业角色。

Abstract: The rapid advance of large-scale AI systems is reshaping how work is divided
between people and machines. We formalise this reallocation as an iterated
task-delegation map and show that--under broad, empirically grounded
assumptions--the process converges to a stable idempotent equilibrium in which
every task is performed by the agent (human or machine) with enduring
comparative advantage. Leveraging lattice-theoretic fixed-point tools (Tarski
and Banach), we (i) prove existence of at least one such equilibrium and (ii)
derive mild monotonicity conditions that guarantee uniqueness. In a stylised
continuous model the long-run automated share takes the closed form $x^* =
\alpha / (\alpha + \beta)$, where $\alpha$ captures the pace of automation and
$\beta$ the rate at which new, human-centric tasks appear; hence full
automation is precluded whenever $\beta > 0$. We embed this analytic result in
three complementary dynamical benchmarks--a discrete linear update, an
evolutionary replicator dynamic, and a continuous Beta-distributed task
spectrum--each of which converges to the same mixed equilibrium and is
reproducible from the provided code-free formulas. A 2025-to-2045 simulation
calibrated to current adoption rates projects automation rising from
approximately 10% of work to approximately 65%, leaving a persistent one-third
of tasks to humans. We interpret that residual as a new profession of workflow
conductor: humans specialise in assigning, supervising and integrating AI
modules rather than competing with them. Finally, we discuss implications for
skill development, benchmark design and AI governance, arguing that policies
which promote "centaur" human-AI teaming can steer the economy toward the
welfare-maximising fixed point.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI代理的购物行为模式，提出卖家策略优化、平台设计及监管的新问题，预示AI主导的电商生态可能引发需求集中与竞争挑战。

Abstract: Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on
behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking,
vision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and
transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why?
We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent
with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first
conduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by
randomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and
platform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually
shop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top
row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption
of a universal "top" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward
endorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally
human-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios
where sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a
seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI
buyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated
shopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across
models and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products,
raising competition questions. Together, our results illuminate how AI agents
may behave in e-commerce settings and surface concrete seller strategy,
platform design, and regulatory questions in an AI-mediated ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对'状态'概念长期缺乏共识和形式化清晰度的问题，研究旨在为智能定义、形式逻辑及科学理论提供数学严谨的基础。

Method: 提出包含状态深度与映射层级的'分层状态网格'，引入'中间元宇宙(IMU)'以显式描述定义者与语言，避免自指与逻辑矛盾，并扩展跨宇宙理论至语言翻译与智能体整合。

Result: 建立了基于'定义=状态'原则的元形式逻辑框架，涵盖时间、语言、智能体与操作，区分宏观/微观跨宇宙操作以增强表达力。

Conclusion: 该研究构建的元理论体系为智能定义及科学理论提供了具有数学严格性、跨领域适用性的基础框架。

Abstract: This study aims to reinforce the theoretical foundation for diverse
systems--including the axiomatic definition of intelligence--by introducing a
mathematically rigorous and unified formal structure for the concept of
'state,' which has long been used without consensus or formal clarity. First, a
'hierarchical state grid' composed of two axes--state depth and mapping
hierarchy--is proposed to provide a unified notational system applicable across
mathematical, physical, and linguistic domains. Next, the 'Intermediate
Meta-Universe (IMU)' is introduced to enable explicit descriptions of definers
(ourselves) and the languages we use, thereby allowing conscious meta-level
operations while avoiding self-reference and logical inconsistency. Building on
this meta-theoretical foundation, this study expands inter-universal theory
beyond mathematics to include linguistic translation and agent integration,
introducing the conceptual division between macrocosm-inter-universal and
microcosm-inter-universal operations for broader expressivity. Through these
contributions, this paper presents a meta-formal logical framework--grounded in
the principle of definition = state--that spans time, language, agents, and
operations, providing a mathematically robust foundation applicable to the
definition of intelligence, formal logic, and scientific theory at large.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出AgentTTS框架，解决多阶段复杂任务中测试时计算资源最优分配的挑战，通过智能代理自主搜索模型与预算分配方案，显著提升搜索效率与任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展(TTS)研究集中于单阶段任务，而现实问题多为多阶段异构子任务构成，需为每个子任务选择合适模型并分配计算预算，传统暴力搜索方法因组合空间庞大且推理成本高而不适用。

Method: 基于四大任务六大数据集的实验发现三个关键现象，提出AgentTTS框架：利用LLM智能体通过与环境反馈的迭代交互，自主搜索计算最优的模型与预算分配方案。

Result: 实验表明AgentTTS在搜索效率上显著优于传统方法及其他LLM基线，对训练集规模变化展现更强鲁棒性，同时提供更优可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多阶段任务中测试时计算优化分配的空白，AgentTTS框架为复杂任务场景下的资源分配问题提供了高效可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models
(LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However,
existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many
real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of
heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability.
Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in
multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate
budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of
model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes
brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations
across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the
compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot
experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical
insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks.
Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework
that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative
feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental
results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and
other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness
to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

*Abeer Dyoub,Ivan Letteri,Francesca A. Lisi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出ff4ERA框架，通过模糊逻辑整合FAHP和确定性因素，量化共生AI中的伦理风险，为符合人类价值观的决策提供支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着共生AI（SAI）的发展，伦理风险评估（ERA）面临不确定性、模糊性和信息不完整等挑战，需灵活透明的框架来指导风险最小化的决策。

Method: ff4ERA框架结合模糊逻辑、模糊层次分析法（FAHP）和确定性因素（CF），通过伦理风险评分（ERS）量化各类风险，提供系统化分步分析方法。

Result: 案例研究表明ff4ERA能生成上下文敏感且伦理意义明确的风险评分，对专家权重和确定性因素具有鲁棒性，支持假设分析和设计校准。

Conclusion: ff4ERA框架能产生可解释、可追踪且风险感知的伦理评估，为可靠伦理决策支持提供数学基础，验证了模型设计的有效性。

Abstract: The emergence of Symbiotic AI (SAI) introduces new challenges to ethical
decision-making as it deepens human-AI collaboration. As symbiosis grows, AI
systems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.
Ethical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that
minimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and
incomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.
This motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for
ERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and
prioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select
actions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce
ff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic
Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks
via an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the
FAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a
robust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,
step-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields
context-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert
input and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant
factors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis
shows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global
Sobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and
certainty factors, validating the model design. Overall, the results
demonstrate ff4ERA ability to produce interpretable, traceable, and risk-aware
ethical assessments, enabling what-if analyses and guiding designers in
calibrating membership functions and expert judgments for reliable ethical
decision support.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究首次将卡尼曼和特沃斯基的'前景理论'应用于大型语言模型(LLM)，发现其风险决策模式与人类相似，且情境框架(尤其是军事场景)会显著影响风险偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证人类风险决策的经典理论(前景理论)是否适用于当前最先进的链式推理大型语言模型，探究语言模型是否继承了人类的启发式与认知偏差。

Method: 通过设计不同情境(军事/民用)的风险决策实验，测试LLM在得失框架下的选择模式，并与前景理论预测进行对比。

Result: 1) LLM表现出与人类相似的风险偏好模式 2)军事场景产生的'框架效应'远强于民用场景 3)风险认知深度依赖语言表述框架，支持维特根斯坦'语言游戏'理论

Conclusion: 语言模型内化了人类的风险认知偏差，但偏差表现具有情境依赖性；研究为LLM的'推理vs记忆'争论提供了新视角，表明其决策机制能反映复杂的语言框架效应。

Abstract: Judgment of risk is key to decision-making under uncertainty. As Daniel
Kahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive
way that departs from mathematical rationalism. Specifically, they demonstrated
experimentally that humans accept more risk when they feel themselves at risk
of losing something than when they might gain. I report the first tests of
Kahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,
including today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.
  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how
these models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also
demonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk
appetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded
within the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I
find that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do
civilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that
language models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also
that these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple
gains and losses. Wittgenstein's notion of 'language games' explains the
contingent, localised biases activated by these scenarios. Finally, I use my
findings to reframe the ongoing debate about reasoning and memorisation in
LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于语义分析的多跳问答知识编辑框架CHECK，通过类比编译器原理优化LLM推理链，在四个数据集上平均提升22.8%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法在组合推理任务（如多跳问答）中表现不佳，主要因分解技术导致非逻辑推理过程。需要开发能保持语义一致性的编辑框架。

Method: CHECK框架将LLM推理类比代码编译：先对推理链进行语义分析，通过逻辑优化和高温重提示修正语义错误，确保推理链一致性后再执行问答。

Result: 在四个数据集上对比五种前沿框架，CHECK实现平均22.8%的多跳问答准确率提升，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入编译器式语义分析机制，CHECK有效解决了组合推理中的知识更新难题，为LLM持续学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require lightweight avenues of updating stored
information that has fallen out of date. Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches have
been successful in updating model knowledge for simple factual queries but
struggle with handling tasks that require compositional reasoning such as
multi-hop question answering (MQA). We observe that existing knowledge editors
leverage decompositional techniques that result in illogical reasoning
processes. In this paper, we propose a knowledge editor for MQA based on
semantic analysis called CHECK. Our framework is based on insights from an
analogy between compilers and reasoning using LLMs. Similar to how source code
is first compiled before being executed, we propose to semantically analyze
reasoning chains before executing the chains to answer questions. Reasoning
chains with semantic errors are revised to ensure consistency through logic
optimization and re-prompting the LLM model at a higher temperature. We
evaluate the effectiveness of CHECK against five state-of-the-art frameworks on
four datasets and achieve an average 22.8% improved MQA accuracy.

Conclusion: AutoEDA作为开源框架，为EDA社区提供了标准化、可扩展的自动化解决方案，支持复现性研究。项目地址：https://github.com/AndyLu666/MCP-EDA-Server

Abstract: Modern Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workflows, especially the
RTL-to-GDSII flow, require heavily manual scripting and demonstrate a multitude
of tool-specific interactions which limits scalability and efficiency. While
LLMs introduces strides for automation, existing LLM solutions require
expensive fine-tuning and do not contain standardized frameworks for
integration and evaluation. We introduce AutoEDA, a framework for EDA
automation that leverages paralleled learning through the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) specific for standardized and scalable natural language
experience across the entire RTL-to-GDSII flow. AutoEDA limits fine-tuning
through structured prompt engineering, implements intelligent parameter
extraction and task decomposition, and provides an extended CodeBLEU metric to
evaluate the quality of TCL scripts. Results from experiments over five
previously curated benchmarks show improvements in automation accuracy and
efficiency, as well as script quality when compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: 该研究证实轻量级VLM可实现实时边缘协同规划，语言引导的上下文推理能显著提升自动驾驶安全性与响应能力。

Abstract: Collisions caused by human error are the most common type of multi-vehicle
crash, highlighting the critical need for autonomous driving (AD) systems to
leverage cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
communication. This capability extends situational awareness beyond the
limitations of onboard sensors. However, current transformer-based V2X
frameworks suffer from limited generalization, shallow contextual reasoning,
and reliance on mono-modal inputs. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer enhanced
reasoning and multimodal integration but typically fall short of real-time
performance requirements in safety-critical applications. This paper presents
REACT, a real-time, V2X-integrated trajectory optimization framework built upon
a fine-tuned lightweight VLM. REACT integrates a set of specialized modules
that process multimodal inputs into optimized, risk-aware trajectories. To
ensure real-time performance on edge devices, REACT incorporates edge
adaptation strategies that reduce model complexity and accelerate inference.
Evaluated on the DeepAccident benchmark, REACT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, a 77% collision rate reduction, a 48.2% Video Panoptic Quality
(VPQ), and a 0.57-second inference latency on the Jetson AGX Orin. Ablation
studies validate the contribution of each input, module, and edge adaptation
strategy. These results demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight VLMs for
real-time edge-based cooperative planning and showcase the potential of
language-guided contextual reasoning to improve safety and responsiveness in
autonomous driving.

Conclusion: gpuRDF2vec使研究者和实践者能在实际时间预算内训练高质量的大规模KG嵌入，为知识图谱嵌入领域提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Generating Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings at web scale remains challenging.
Among existing techniques, RDF2vec combines effectiveness with strong
scalability. We present gpuRDF2vec, an open source library that harnesses
modern GPUs and supports multi-node execution to accelerate every stage of the
RDF2vec pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetically generated graphs
and real-world benchmarks show that gpuRDF2vec achieves up to a substantial
speedup over the currently fastest alternative, i.e., jRDF2vec. In a
single-node setup, our walk-extraction phase alone outperforms pyRDF2vec,
SparkKGML, and jRDF2vec by a substantial margin using random walks on large/
dense graphs, and scales very well to longer walks, which typically lead to
better quality embeddings. Our implementation of gpuRDF2vec enables
practitioners and researchers to train high-quality KG embeddings on
large-scale graphs within practical time budgets and builds on top of Pytorch
Lightning for the scalable word2vec implementation.

*Neil F. Johnson,Frank Yingjie Huo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 生成式AI（如ChatGPT）的输出存在从正确突变为误导性错误的风险，2024年因此造成670亿美元损失及多起死亡事件。研究通过建立多自旋热系统数学模型，揭示了AI基本注意力头的隐藏临界点不稳定性，并推导出临界点公式，量化了用户提示和训练偏差的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI输出存在不可预测的突变风险，可能导致重大经济损失和人身伤害，亟需揭示其内在机制以提高透明度和可解释性。

Method: 将AI基本注意力头映射到多自旋热系统，建立数学模型并推导临界点公式，分析多层架构对输出突变的放大效应。

Result: 发现AI注意力头存在隐藏的临界不稳定性，推导出精确公式$\Theta_{\text{tip}} = f(\beta, \mathbf{p})$，量化了提示选择$\mathbf{p}$和训练偏差$\beta$的影响，证明多层结构会放大突变效应。

Conclusion: 研究为提升AI透明度、性能及量化用户风险责任提供了新路径，临界点公式可直接用于评估法律赔偿责任。

Abstract: Output from generative AI such as ChatGPT, can be repetitive and biased. But
more worrying is that this output can mysteriously tip mid-response from good
(correct) to bad (misleading or wrong) without the user noticing. In 2024
alone, this reportedly caused $67 billion in losses and several deaths.
Establishing a mathematical mapping to a multispin thermal system, we reveal a
hidden tipping instability at the scale of the AI's 'atom' (basic Attention
head). We derive a simple but essentially exact formula for this tipping point
which shows directly the impact of a user's prompt choice and the AI's training
bias. We then show how the output tipping can get amplified by the AI's
multilayer architecture. As well as helping improve AI transparency,
explainability and performance, our results open a path to quantifying users'
AI risk and legal liabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究通过卫星图像和网络文本预测非洲家庭财富，发现融合视觉与语言模型优于单一方法，并验证了部分表征收敛假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨社会经济指标（如家庭财富）是否能在卫星图像和网络文本中留下可恢复的痕迹，以提升财富预测的准确性。

Method: 结合DHS数据、Landsat图像、LLM生成文本及AI代理检索的网页文本，开发多模态框架，通过五种预测管道（视觉模型、LLM、AI代理、联合编码器、集成模型）进行财富预测。

Result: 融合视觉与语言模型（R平方0.77）优于纯视觉基线（0.63），LLM内部知识比代理检索文本更有效；表征部分收敛（余弦相似度0.60），支持柏拉图表征假说；代理数据虽效果有限，但在某些情况下提供独特信息。

Conclusion: 多模态融合显著提升财富预测性能，LLM知识更具鲁棒性，同时发布包含6万DHS集群的多模态数据集，为后续研究提供资源。

Abstract: We investigate whether socio-economic indicators like household wealth leave
recoverable imprints in satellite imagery (capturing physical features) and
Internet-sourced text (reflecting historical/economic narratives). Using
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair
Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on
location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We
develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International
Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images,
(ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web
text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework
yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms
vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on
out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than
agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time
generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused
embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine
similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of
material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms
agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest
gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that
agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not
fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale
multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite
images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种受海马体启发的连续学习方法H2C，用于解决自动驾驶轨迹预测中的灾难性遗忘问题，通过选择性记忆回放有效保留旧知识，在多种场景下平均减少基线模型22.71%的遗忘率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习轨迹预测方法存在灾难性遗忘问题，难以适应动态变化的真实驾驶场景。受神经科学中海马体记忆回放机制启发，研究旨在开发可跨场景持续学习的算法。

Method: H2C方法包含两个核心策略：1) 最大化样本多样性选择策略保留差异性知识；2) 等概率抽样策略保持整体知识表征。通过记忆回放损失函数更新模型，实现无任务依赖的持续学习。

Result: 在INTERACTION数据集多场景测试中，H2C无需人工标注分布变化，即以任务无关方式平均降低基线模型22.71%的遗忘率，代码已开源。

Conclusion: 海马体启发的H2C方法通过生物合理的记忆机制有效缓解灾难性遗忘，为自动驾驶系统在动态环境中的持续学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has shown state-of-the-art performance in trajectory
prediction, which is critical to safe navigation in autonomous driving (AD).
However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where
adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in
previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits
their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across
varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the
hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively
reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this,
we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for
trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by
selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two
complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent
learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity
to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall
knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss
function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while
learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION
dataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C
reduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a
task-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts.
The implementation is available at https://github.com/BIT-Jack/H2C-lifelong.

TL;DR: 本文提出CA-MER基准测试揭示现有多模态大语言模型(MLLM)在情绪冲突场景中的音频依赖偏差，并开发参数高效框架MoSEAR，通过模态专家与注意力重分配机制实现平衡模态整合，在多个基准测试中达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在多模态情绪推理中忽视情绪冲突场景（各模态情绪线索不一致），CA-MER基准的构建揭示了当前模型系统性过度依赖音频信号的问题。

Method: 提出MoSEAR框架：1) MoSE模块通过正则化门控机制减少微调头中的模态偏差；2) AR模块在推理时通过注意力重分配平衡冻结主干网络的模态贡献。

Result: 在MER2023、EMER、DFEW及CA-MER上的实验表明，MoSEAR不仅缓解情绪冲突，在一致样本上也有性能提升，且在模态冲突条件下表现最优。

Conclusion: MoSEAR以参数高效方式实现模态平衡整合，无需音频与视觉模态间的权衡，为多模态情绪推理中的冲突问题提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving
emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are
inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark
designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of
three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or
all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER
reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on
audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual
modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient
framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two
modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism
that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention
reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen
backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it
mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent
samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities.
Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our
CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance,
particularly under modality conflict conditions.

Abstract: In the age of large language models (LLMs), autonomous agents have emerged as
a powerful paradigm for achieving general intelligence. These agents
dynamically leverage tools, memory, and reasoning capabilities to accomplish
user-defined goals. As agent systems grow in complexity, agent
workflows-structured orchestration frameworks-have become central to enabling
scalable, controllable, and secure AI behaviors. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of agent workflow systems, spanning academic frameworks
and industrial implementations. We classify existing systems along two key
dimensions: functional capabilities (e.g., planning, multi-agent collaboration,
external API integration) and architectural features (e.g., agent roles,
orchestration flows, specification languages). By comparing over 20
representative systems, we highlight common patterns, potential technical
challenges, and emerging trends. We further address concerns related to
workflow optimization strategies and security. Finally, we outline open
problems such as standardization and multimodal integration, offering insights
for future research at the intersection of agent design, workflow
infrastructure, and safe automation.

*Chengshuai Zhao,Zhen Tan,Pingchuan Ma,Dawei Li,Bohan Jiang,Yancheng Wang,Yingzhen Yang,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现Chain-of-Thought (CoT)推理更像是一种从训练数据中学习到的表面模式，而非真正的推理能力，其有效性受限于训练与测试数据的分布一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CoT提示能提升大语言模型表现，但初步迹象表明其推理可能仅是表面现象，促使研究者从数据分布角度探究其本质。

Method: 通过设计DataAlchemy实验环境，从任务、长度、格式三个维度系统分析CoT推理，并在受控条件下训练模型以观察分布变化的影响。

Result: 实验表明CoT推理具有脆弱性——当测试数据超出训练分布时，其推理能力会迅速失效，证实其本质是数据驱动的模式模仿。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了CoT推理的局限性，强调当前模型仍缺乏真正可泛化的推理能力，为未来研究提供了关键方向。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language
Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to
produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT
reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate
inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT
reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore
further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and
investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from
in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning
paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is
fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the
training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning
via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,
we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs
from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution
conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that
vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a
deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the
ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出BIS框架，一种无需真实标签即可预测大语言模型代码生成性能的提示中心评估方法，显著降低基准测试成本并解决数据污染问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准面临两大挑战：高质量测试套件构建成本高昂，以及数据污染风险增加，影响评估可靠性。

Method: 基于重要性采样理论和重要性加权自编码器，通过重加权现有标注基准样本来预测新基准性能，引入权重截断策略和边际期望计算以稳定估计。

Result: 在4个CodeLlama模型和9个基准的8000个评估点上，代码正确性预测平均绝对误差1.1%，pass@1指标误差2.15%，验证了框架可靠性。

Conclusion: BIS作为资源受限时的补充工具，可大幅降低代码相关任务中LLM基准测试的成本与工作量，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models , code generation has
become a key benchmark for evaluating LLM capabilities. However, existing
benchmarks face two major challenges: (1) the escalating cost of constructing
high-quality test suites and reference solutions, and (2) the increasing risk
of data contamination, which undermines the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations. In this paper, we propose BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation
framework that enables ground-truth-free prediction of LLM performance on code
generation tasks. Rather than executing generated code, BIS estimates
performance metrics by analyzing the prompt distribution alone. Built on
importance sampling theory and implemented using Importance Weighted
Autoencoders, our method reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks
to estimate performance on new, unseen benchmarks. To stabilize the estimation,
we introduce weight truncation strategies and compute marginal expectations
across the fitted distributions. BIS serves as a complementary tool that
supports benchmark development and validation under constrained resources,
offering actionable and quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination
assessment. We conduct extensive experiments involving 8,000 evaluation points
across 4 CodeLlama models and 9 diverse benchmarks. Our framework achieves an
average absolute prediction error of 1.1% for code correctness scores, with
best- and worst-case errors of 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively. It also generalizes
well to other metrics, attaining average absolute errors of 2.15% for pass@1.
These results demonstrate the reliability and broad applicability of BIS, which
can significantly reduce the cost and effort of benchmarking LLMs in
code-related tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合显著性检验与共形预测框架的新型故障检测方法，通过假设检验和数学保证的风险控制，提升了复杂场景下诊断系统的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有故障诊断模型缺乏严格的风险控制和不确定性量化能力，尤其在面对分布偏移等复杂场景时表现不足，亟需理论严谨的解决方案。

Method: 将故障检测转化为假设检验任务，基于模型残差定义非一致性度量，利用校准数据集计算新样本的p值，构建数学保证覆盖真实标签的预测集（置信度$1-\alpha$），通过预测集与预设标签集的交集实现故障分类。

Result: 跨域故障诊断实验表明：1) 经验覆盖率始终不低于理论值$1-\alpha$；2) 即使基础预测模型性能差仍保持稳健；3) 风险水平$\alpha$与预测集效率存在可控权衡。

Conclusion: 该研究为安全关键领域提供了具有显式风险控制的理论框架，推动故障诊断从单点预测迈向不确定性感知的输出范式，显著提升了诊断系统的可信度。

Abstract: Fault detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of modern
industrial systems. However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of
rigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing
diagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as
distributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault
detection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal
prediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms
fault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity
measure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to
compute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets
mathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified
probability, $1-\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by
analyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined
normal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault
diagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The
proposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above
the nominal level ($1-\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the
underlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results
reveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\alpha$)
and efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction
set sizes. This research contributes a theoretically grounded framework for
fault detection that enables explicit risk control, enhancing the
trustworthiness of diagnostic systems in safety-critical applications and
advancing the field from simple point predictions to informative,
uncertainty-aware outputs.

Motivation: 手绘草图虽能高效传递创意，但由于其结构模糊性，自动转换为机器可读图表仍依赖人工。现有技术难以解决草图语义不精确的问题。

Method: SketchAgent整合草图识别、符号推理和迭代验证三模块，通过多智能体系统实现语义连贯且结构准确的图表生成。

Result: 构建的Sketch2Diagram基准涵盖8类图表（如流程图、有向图等），提供标准化预处理和质量控制，系统显著降低人工干预需求。

Conclusion: 该技术在设计/教育/工程领域具有应用潜力，其基准数据集（https:\/\/huggingface.co\/datasets\/DiagramAgent\/Sketch2Diagram-Benchmark）推动了草图到图表的自动化进程。

Abstract: Hand-drawn sketches are a natural and efficient medium for capturing and
conveying ideas. Despite significant advancements in controllable natural image
generation, translating freehand sketches into structured, machine-readable
diagrams remains a labor-intensive and predominantly manual task. The primary
challenge stems from the inherent ambiguity of sketches, which lack the
structural constraints and semantic precision required for automated diagram
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce SketchAgent, a multi-agent
system designed to automate the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into
structured diagrams. SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic
reasoning, and iterative validation to produce semantically coherent and
structurally accurate diagrams, significantly reducing the need for manual
effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the
Sketch2Diagram Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework
encompassing eight diverse diagram categories, such as flowcharts, directed
graphs, and model architectures. The dataset comprises over 6,000 high-quality
examples with token-level annotations, standardized preprocessing, and rigorous
quality control. By streamlining the diagram generation process, SketchAgent
holds great promise for applications in design, education, and engineering,
while offering a significant step toward bridging the gap between intuitive
sketching and machine-readable diagram generation. The benchmark is released at

Conclusion: 架构创新（而非参数扩展）能突破资源受限场景的语言模型效率边界，压缩比r=d/2时实现推理加速与内存优化的最佳平衡。

Abstract: We present MoE-MLA-RoPE, a novel architecture combination that combines
Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Rotary
Position Embeddings (RoPE) for efficient language modeling. Our approach
addresses the fundamental trade-off between model capacity and computational
efficiency through three key innovations: (1) fine-grained expert routing with
64 micro-experts and top-$k$ selection, enabling flexible specialization
through 3.6 * 10^7 possible expert combinations; (2) shared expert isolation
that dedicates 2 always active experts for common patterns while routing to 6
of 62 specialized experts; and (3) gradient-conflict-free load balancing that
maintains expert utilization without interfering with primary loss
optimization.
  Extensive experiments on models ranging from 17M to 202M parameters
demonstrate that MoE-MLA-RoPE with compression ratio r=d/2 achieves 68% KV
cache memory reduction and 3.2x inference speedup while maintaining competitive
perplexity (0.8% degradation). Compared to the parameters with 53.9M
parameters, MoE-MLA-RoPE improves the validation loss by 6.9% over the vanilla
transformers while using 42% fewer active parameters per forward pass.
FLOP-matched experiments reveal even larger gains: 11.1% improvement with 3.2x
inference acceleration. Automated evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge confirms
quality improvements in generation, with higher scores on coherence (8.1/10),
creativity (7.9/10) and grammatical correctness (8.2/10). Our results establish
that architectural novelty, not parameter scaling, defines the efficiency
frontier for resource-constrained language model deployment.

Motivation: 小型语言模型（SLMs）因其高效性和在资源受限环境中的可部署性而受到重视，但成员推理攻击（MIAs）对其隐私和知识产权的威胁尚未充分研究，且攻击效果随模型规模减小而降低。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于最先进攻击方法（min-k）的新型MIA——win-k，并通过三个数据集和八个SLMs与五种现有MIAs进行了实验比较。

Result: 实验结果表明，win-k在AUROC、TPR @ 1% FPR和FPR @ 99% TPR等指标上优于现有MIAs，尤其在较小模型上表现更为显著。

Conclusion: win-k作为一种新型MIA，在小型语言模型上表现出更高的攻击效果，为SLMs的隐私保护研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly valued for their efficiency and
deployability in resource-constrained environments, making them useful for
on-device, privacy-sensitive, and edge computing applications. On the other
hand, membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a
given sample was used in a model's training, are an important threat with
serious privacy and intellectual property implications. In this paper, we study
MIAs on SLMs. Although MIAs were shown to be effective on large language models
(LLMs), they are relatively less studied on emerging SLMs, and furthermore,
their effectiveness decreases as models get smaller. Motivated by this finding,
we propose a new MIA called win-k, which builds on top of a state-of-the-art
attack (min-k). We experimentally evaluate win-k by comparing it with five
existing MIAs using three datasets and eight SLMs. Results show that win-k
outperforms existing MIAs in terms of AUROC, TPR @ 1% FPR, and FPR @ 99% TPR
metrics, especially on smaller models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的普及，跨上下文的知识冲突问题日益突出，模型常因冗长且矛盾的上下文而混淆。亟需提升LLMs解决知识冲突的能力。

Method: KCR框架首先从冲突长文本中提取文本或局部知识图谱形式的推理路径，再通过强化学习奖励模型选择逻辑一致的推理路径，从而学习正确的推理范式。

Result: 实验表明，KCR显著提升了多种骨干模型在长文本场景下解决知识冲突的能力，并带来明显的性能增益。

Conclusion: KCR框架使骨干模型真正掌握了在长文本中解决跨上下文知识冲突的能力，为复杂知识推理任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge conflicts commonly arise across diverse sources, and their
prevalence has increased with the advent of LLMs. When dealing with conflicts
between multiple contexts, also known as \emph{inter-context knowledge
conflicts}, LLMs are often confused by lengthy and conflicting contexts. To
address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR)
framework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge.
The key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning
process by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with
stronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts.
Specifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or
local knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we
employ Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of
reasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the
incorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire
the capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long
contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts
in long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains.

*Jui-Ming Yao,Bing-Cheng Xie,Sheng-Wei Peng,Hao-Yuan Chen,He-Rong Zheng,Bing-Jia Tan,Peter Shaojui Wang,Shun-Feng Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了首个针对传统中文的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）评估基准Multi-TW，涵盖图像、音频和文本输入，旨在解决现有基准在传统中文三模态评估和推理延迟方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准常忽略传统中文的三模态评估且未考虑推理延迟，因此需要开发一个全面评估多模态模型性能和延迟的基准。

Method: Multi-TW包含900道多选题（图像与文本、音频与文本配对），数据来源于华语能力测验（SC-TOP）。评估了多种任意模态模型及视觉语言模型（VLMs）加音频转录的性能和延迟。

Result: 闭源模型在多模态任务中普遍优于开源模型，但开源模型在音频任务中表现良好。端到端任意模态流程在延迟上明显优于使用独立音频转录的VLMs。

Conclusion: Multi-TW提供了模型能力的全面视图，并强调了传统中文微调和高效多模态架构的必要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process visual, acoustic, and
textual inputs, addressing the limitations of single-modality LLMs. However,
existing benchmarks often overlook tri-modal evaluation in Traditional Chinese
and do not consider inference latency. To address this, we introduce Multi-TW,
the first Traditional Chinese benchmark for evaluating the performance and
latency of any-to-any multimodal models. Multi-TW includes 900 multiple-choice
questions (image and text, audio and text pairs) sourced from official
proficiency tests developed with the Steering Committee for the Test of
Proficiency-Huayu (SC-TOP). We evaluated various any-to-any models and
vision-language models (VLMs) with audio transcription. Our results show that
closed-source models generally outperform open-source ones across modalities,
although open-source models can perform well in audio tasks. End-to-end
any-to-any pipelines offer clear latency advantages compared to VLMs using
separate audio transcription. Multi-TW presents a comprehensive view of model
capabilities and highlights the need for Traditional Chinese fine-tuning and
efficient multimodal architectures.

TL;DR: BioDisco是一个多智能体框架，用于生成新颖且基于证据的科学假设，通过语言模型推理和双模式证据系统实现，支持迭代优化，并通过时间和人工评估验证性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学假设的生成面临信息过载和复杂性挑战，现有自动化方法难以产生新颖且基于证据的假设，缺乏迭代优化和严格的未来发现潜力评估。

Method: BioDisco结合语言模型推理和双模式证据系统（生物医学知识图谱和自动化文献检索），集成内部评分和反馈循环进行迭代优化，并通过时间和人工评估及Bradley-Terry配对比较模型进行性能验证。

Result: 评估表明，BioDisco在新颖性和重要性上优于现有智能体架构的简化配置，具有灵活性和模块化设计，可轻松集成自定义语言模型或知识图谱。

Conclusion: BioDisco是一个实用工具，有望成为新假设发现的催化剂，支持研究者通过简单代码运行。

Abstract: Identifying novel hypotheses is essential to scientific research, yet this
process risks being overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of available
information. Existing automated methods often struggle to generate novel and
evidence-grounded hypotheses, lack robust iterative refinement and rarely
undergo rigorous temporal evaluation for future discovery potential. To address
this, we propose BioDisco, a multi-agent framework that draws upon language
model-based reasoning and a dual-mode evidence system (biomedical knowledge
graphs and automated literature retrieval) for grounded novelty, integrates an
internal scoring and feedback loop for iterative refinement, and validates
performance through pioneering temporal and human evaluations and a
Bradley-Terry paired comparison model to provide statistically-grounded
assessment. Our evaluations demonstrate superior novelty and significance over
ablated configurations representative of existing agentic architectures.
Designed for flexibility and modularity, BioDisco allows seamless integration
of custom language models or knowledge graphs, and can be run with just a few
lines of code. We anticipate researchers using this practical tool as a
catalyst for the discovery of new hypotheses.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PCF（多态组合框架）结合大型语言模型（LLM）与数学框架，通过元提示设计动态AI代理的解决方案空间，支持实时参数调整以适应复杂环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态代理架构无法适应动态环境，PCF旨在通过数学基础实现代理行为的动态调整，提升AI在复杂场景中的适应性和可扩展性。

Method: 基于组合逻辑、拓扑理论和粗糙模糊集理论，PCF定义了多维SPARK参数空间（技能、个性、方法、资源、知识），利用LLM参数化复杂空间并进行蒙特卡洛模拟（超125万次）。

Result: 模拟实验显示代理在五个复杂度层级中的适应性和性能趋势，高复杂度下收益递减，揭示了可扩展设计的阈值。

Conclusion: PCF能生成特定场景优化的代理配置，保持逻辑一致性，为客服、医疗、机器人等领域的动态、可解释、伦理AI应用提供基础，推动下一代多态代理发展。

Abstract: The Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF) leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) and mathematical frameworks to guide the meta-prompt enabled design of
solution spaces and adaptive AI agents for complex, dynamic environments.
Unlike static agent architectures, PCF enables real-time parameter
reconfiguration through mathematically-grounded combinatorial spaces, allowing
agents to adapt their core behavioral traits dynamically. Grounded in
combinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a
multidimensional SPARK parameter space (Skills, Personalities, Approaches,
Resources, Knowledge) to capture agent behaviors. This paper demonstrates how
LLMs can parameterize complex spaces and estimate likely parameter
values/variabilities. Using PCF, we parameterized mock caf\'e domains (five
levels of complexity), estimated variables/variabilities, and conducted over
1.25 million Monte Carlo simulations. The results revealed trends in agent
adaptability and performance across the five complexity tiers, with diminishing
returns at higher complexity levels highlighting thresholds for scalable
designs. PCF enables the generation of optimized agent configurations for
specific scenarios while maintaining logical consistency. This framework
supports scalable, dynamic, explainable, and ethical AI applications in domains
like customer service, healthcare, robotics, and collaborative systems, paving
the way for adaptable and cooperative next-generation polymorphic agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在AI规划任务中的表现，提出了一种基于自然语言处理（NLP）的恢复流程，以提升LLMs生成计划的质量和可靠性。研究发现，LLMs生成的计划质量仍不及传统规划器，但通过NLP分析和恢复机制可部分改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在AI规划任务中展现出潜力，但其生成的计划常包含错误或虚构动作，可靠性不足。现有评估方法主要关注成功率，缺乏对无效计划质量的全面分析。本文旨在通过NLP方法提升LLMs在规划任务中的表现。

Method: 提出了一种包含NLP评估和三阶段恢复流程的管道，通过NLP操作LLMs生成的计划，最终使用符号规划器完成计划。该方法旨在全面分析LLMs在AI任务规划中的能力。

Result: 研究发现，LLMs在计划生成过程中缺乏明显的底层推理能力。恢复管道平均仅能执行计划中的前2.65个动作，符号生成计划的平均长度为8.4个动作。管道将整体成功率从21.9%提升至27.5%。

Conclusion: 尽管NLP分析和恢复机制能部分提升LLMs生成计划的质量和成功率，但其表现仍不及传统规划器。LLMs在规划任务中的可靠性仍需进一步改进。

Abstract: The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
been a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take
unstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI
planning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as
planners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated
actions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with
LLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various
planning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In
this paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing
(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery
pipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along
with three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the
LLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.
This pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context
of AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid
plans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during
plan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the
plans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and
reliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of
the plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated
plans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and
increases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PUZZLED的新型越狱攻击方法，通过将有害指令中的关键词以字谜形式呈现，利用大语言模型（LLM）的推理能力绕过安全检测。该方法在五种先进LLM上实现了88.8%的平均攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）应用场景的扩展，其安全性问题日益突出。现有越狱攻击方法多依赖迭代提示工程或语义转换，需要更高效的新型攻击策略。

Method: PUZZLED方法将有害指令的关键词隐藏于三种字谜（寻词游戏、变位词、填字游戏）中，迫使LLM先解谜还原指令再生成响应。这些字谜对人类简单但对LLM具有认知挑战性。

Result: 在五种先进LLM上的测试显示：平均攻击成功率（ASR）达88.8%，其中GPT-4.1为96.5%，Claude 3.7 Sonnet为92.3%。

Conclusion: PUZZLED通过将常见字谜转化为越狱工具，简单高效地利用LLM的推理能力，揭示了现有安全防御体系的潜在漏洞。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
domains, ensuring their safety has become a critical concern. In response,
studies on jailbreak attacks have been actively growing. Existing approaches
typically rely on iterative prompt engineering or semantic transformations of
harmful instructions to evade detection. In this work, we introduce PUZZLED, a
novel jailbreak method that leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities. It
masks keywords in a harmful instruction and presents them as word puzzles for
the LLM to solve. We design three puzzle types-word search, anagram, and
crossword-that are familiar to humans but cognitively demanding for LLMs. The
model must solve the puzzle to uncover the masked words and then proceed to
generate responses to the reconstructed harmful instruction. We evaluate
PUZZLED on five state-of-the-art LLMs and observe a high average attack success
rate (ASR) of 88.8%, specifically 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7
Sonnet. PUZZLED is a simple yet powerful attack that transforms familiar
puzzles into an effective jailbreak strategy by harnessing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the limitations of existing unlearning evaluation metrics
in terms of practicality, exactness, and robustness in real-world LLM

called Distribution Correction-based Unlearning Evaluation (DCUE). It
identifies core tokens and corrects distributional biases in their confidence
scores using a validation set. The evaluation results are quantified using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Experimental results demonstrate that DCUE overcomes
the limitations of existing metrics, which also guides the design of more
practical and reliable unlearning algorithms in the future.

Motivation: 现有评估基准在准确性、可复现性和可扩展性上的严重不足阻碍了LLM驱动的GUI代理的快速发展，亟需新的评估标准和方法。

Method: 设计基于因果路径的\Benchmark基准（将复杂任务分解为可编程验证的原子步骤），开发分层架构的\Agent生成高质量轨迹数据集，并对Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型进行强化微调(RFT)。

Result: \Benchmark对现有LLM构成严峻挑战（Claude-sonnet-4的WPSR仅34.6%），RFT虽提升小模型性能（WPSR从3.3%升至10.8%），但在复杂场景下表现急剧下降。

Conclusion: 研究为GUI代理领域提供了严谨的评估标准和高质量数据集，揭示了小模型在整合感知、决策与执行的综合任务中存在能力天花板。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Graphical User
Interface (GUI) agents is significantly hampered by the profound limitations of
existing evaluation benchmarks in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and
scalability. To address this critical gap, we introduce \Benchmark, a novel
benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm
structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic
steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for
assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of
agents, we developed \Agent, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically
optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a
high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse
and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this
dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model.
Our experiments reveal that \Benchmark~presents a formidable challenge to
current state-of-the-art LLMs; even the top-performing Claude-sonnet-4 achieved
a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of only 34.6\%. Moreover, while RFT
substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR
increased from 3.3\% to 10.8\%), its performance degraded sharply when handling
complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of
smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception,
decision-making, and execution. This research contributes a rigorous evaluation
standard and a high-quality dataset to the community, aiming to guide the
future development of GUI agents.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于固定POI集的封闭世界假设方法无法有效捕捉探索性行为与道路网络拓扑约束，需开发更灵活的预测框架。

Method: 1) 构建道路交叉口图表示轨迹；2) 设计扇形方向POI聚合编码环境上下文；3) 提出关系感知LNN-Transformer混合模型（CFC-LNN与方位偏置自注意力模块结合）建模时空依赖。

Result: 在城市规模轨迹数据上：1) 单跳预测准确率超越基线17%；2) MRR提升10%；3) 抗噪性强（50米GPS扰动下准确率仅降2.4%，25% POI噪声下准确率降8.9%）。

Conclusion: 该框架通过解耦封闭世界假设、融合拓扑与语义特征、创新序列建模架构，实现了更鲁棒的道路用户移动行为预测。

Abstract: Next-step location prediction plays a pivotal role in modeling human
mobility, underpinning applications from personalized navigation to strategic
urban planning. However, approaches that assume a closed world - restricting
choices to a predefined set of points of interest (POIs) - often fail to
capture exploratory or target-agnostic behavior and the topological constraints
of urban road networks. Hence, we introduce a road-node-centric framework that
represents road-user trajectories on the city's road-intersection graph,
thereby relaxing the closed-world constraint and supporting next-step
forecasting beyond fixed POI sets. To encode environmental context, we
introduce a sector-wise directional POI aggregation that produces compact
features capturing distance, bearing, density and presence cues. By combining
these cues with structural graph embeddings, we obtain semantically grounded
node representations. For sequence modeling, we integrate a Relation-Aware
LNN-Transformer - a hybrid of a Continuous-time Forgetting Cell CfC-LNN and a
bearing-biased self-attention module - to capture both fine-grained temporal
dynamics and long-range spatial dependencies. Evaluated on city-scale road-user
trajectories, our model outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines by up to 17
percentage points in accuracy at one hop and 10 percentage points in MRR, and
maintains high resilience under noise, losing only 2.4 percentage points in
accuracy at one under 50 meter GPS perturbation and 8.9 percentage points in
accuracy at one hop under 25 percent POI noise.

Motivation: 现有旅行规划评估依赖模拟数据，无法反映真实差异，且指标过于侧重约束条件，缺乏对行程整体质量的全面评估。

Method: 构建包含50万+真实POI和近4000条多样化行程的TripTailor数据集，建立更真实的评估框架，分析行程可行性、合理性和个性化定制等维度。

Conclusion: TripTailor基准有望推动旅行规划智能体的发展，使其能真正理解用户需求并生成实用行程。代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: The continuous evolution and enhanced reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) have elevated their role in complex tasks, notably in
travel planning, where demand for personalized, high-quality itineraries is
rising. However, current benchmarks often rely on unrealistic simulated data,
failing to reflect the differences between LLM-generated and real-world
itineraries. Existing evaluation metrics, which primarily emphasize
constraints, fall short of providing a comprehensive assessment of the overall
quality of travel plans. To address these limitations, we introduce TripTailor,
a benchmark designed specifically for personalized travel planning in
real-world scenarios. This dataset features an extensive collection of over
500,000 real-world points of interest (POIs) and nearly 4,000 diverse travel
itineraries, complete with detailed information, providing a more authentic
evaluation framework. Experiments show that fewer than 10\% of the itineraries
generated by the latest state-of-the-art LLMs achieve human-level performance.
Moreover, we identify several critical challenges in travel planning, including
the feasibility, rationality, and personalized customization of the proposed
solutions. We hope that TripTailor will drive the development of travel
planning agents capable of understanding and meeting user needs while
generating practical itineraries. Our code and dataset are available at

Abstract: Relational reasoning lies at the core of many NLP tasks, drawing on
complementary signals from text and graphs. While prior research has
investigated how to leverage this dual complementarity, a detailed and
systematic understanding of text-graph interplay and its effect on hybrid
models remains underexplored. We take an analysis-driven approach to
investigate text-graph representation complementarity via a unified
architecture that supports knowledge co-distillation (CoD). We explore five
tasks involving relational reasoning that differ in how text and graph
structures encode the information needed to solve that task. By tracking how
these dual representations evolve during training, we uncover interpretable
patterns of alignment and divergence, and provide insights into when and why
their integration is beneficial.

Method: 1) 证明问题属于NP难问题；2) 提出基于混合整数线性规划(MILP)的精确解法；3) 设计高效启发式算法；4) 使用真实数据对比基准策略EDF和NDF。

Result: 启发式算法相比EDF和NDF分别降低充电成本39%和22%，同时保持相近的配送完成量。

Conclusion: CARGO框架有效平衡充电成本与配送效率，为城市电动物流提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: With growing interest in sustainable logistics, electric vehicle (EV)-based
deliveries offer a promising alternative for urban distribution. However, EVs
face challenges due to their limited battery capacity, requiring careful
planning for recharging. This depends on factors such as the charging point
(CP) availability, cost, proximity, and vehicles' state of charge (SoC). We
propose CARGO, a framework addressing the EV-based delivery route planning
problem (EDRP), which jointly optimizes route planning and charging for
deliveries within time windows. After proving the problem's NP-hardness, we
propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based exact solution and a
computationally efficient heuristic method. Using real-world datasets, we
evaluate our methods by comparing the heuristic to the MILP solution, and
benchmarking it against baseline strategies, Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and
Nearest Delivery First (NDF). The results show up to 39% and 22% reductions in
the charging cost over EDF and NDF, respectively, while completing comparable
deliveries.

Motivation: 现有MAPF算法使用简化动力学模型，导致生成的路径计划无法被智能体直接执行，需开发能兼顾动力学可行性与不确定性的优化方法。

Method: 提出kTPG算法将MAPF方案细化为动力学可行计划；进一步设计WinkTPG框架，采用窗口机制增量优化并动态整合执行中的智能体信息。

Conclusion: WinkTPG框架有效解决了MAPF计划与动力学执行的鸿沟，通过实时优化显著提升大规模多智能体系统的路径执行质量与效率。

Abstract: Planning collision-free paths for a large group of agents is a challenging
problem with numerous real-world applications. While recent advances in
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) have shown promising progress, standard MAPF
algorithms rely on simplified kinodynamic models, preventing agents from
directly following the generated MAPF plan. To bridge this gap, we propose
kinodynamic Temporal Plan Graph Planning (kTPG), a multi-agent speed
optimization algorithm that efficiently refines a MAPF plan into a
kinodynamically feasible plan while accounting for uncertainties and preserving
collision-freeness. Building on kTPG, we propose Windowed kTPG (WinkTPG), a
MAPF execution framework that incrementally refines MAPF plans using a
window-based mechanism, dynamically incorporating agent information during
execution to reduce uncertainty. Experiments show that WinkTPG can generate
speed profiles for up to 1,000 agents in 1 second and improves solution quality
by up to 51.7% over existing MAPF execution methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于偏好的微调对LLM性能提升至关重要，但依赖高质量训练数据。人工反馈成本高且难以扩展，需要自动化解决方案提升数据质量。

Method: Refine-n-Judge采用迭代方法：LLM先生成改进答案，再评估改进是否有效。当LLM认为初始答案优于改进时停止迭代，生成质量递增的偏好标记数据用于微调。

Result: 在5个公共数据集(编程/数学/对话等)上测试，经Refine-n-Judge增强的模型(Llama 3.1-8B/3.3-70B)在74%比较中优于原数据集微调模型。性能提升：AlpacaEval系列+5%，MT-Bench+19%。

Conclusion: Refine-n-Judge能自动生成高质量数据集，实现可扩展的模型改进，为LLM训练提供高效的数据优化方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress through
preference-based fine-tuning, which critically depends on the quality of the
underlying training data. While human feedback is essential for improving data
quality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce
Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as
both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing
iterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate
refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every
iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human
annotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response
and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer.
This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the
refinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of
increasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public
datasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and
conversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on
Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of
comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4.
Additionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval
2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench. Our results indicate that Refine-n-Judge produces

*Emilio Barkett,Olivia Long,Paul Kröger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在高风险领域自主决策时可能继承人类认知偏差，如承诺升级。研究发现其偏差表现高度依赖情境：个体决策时理性，但多智能体协商或复合压力下会显著出现承诺升级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在自主决策角色中可能继承人类认知偏差（如承诺升级），但偏差表现条件尚不明确。研究旨在揭示LLMs在何种情境下会系统性出现此类偏差。

Method: 采用四组实验条件（模型作为投资者/顾问、多智能体协商、复合压力场景），通过两阶段投资任务进行N=6,500次试验，量化不同情境下的承诺升级行为。

Result: 个体决策时LLMs表现理性（承诺升级极少）；多智能体对称协商时承诺升级率高达99.2%；复合压力下对失败项目平均投入达68.95%。层级结构会显著影响偏差表现。

Conclusion: LLMs的认知偏差并非固有特性，而是高度依赖社会与组织情境。这对多智能体系统部署及无监督操作具有重要警示意义，需防范自然情境触发的系统性决策偏差。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous
decision-making roles across high-stakes domains. However, since models are
trained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that
systematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,
where decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to
prior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique
challenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear
whether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering
conditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment
task across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,
multi-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500
trials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In
individual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate
strong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.
However, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,
N = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates
(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal
escalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and
personal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of
escalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).
These findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social
and organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant
implications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised
operations where such conditions may emerge naturally.

Abstract: Data preparation is a critical step in enhancing the usability of tabular
data and thus boosts downstream data-driven tasks. Traditional methods often
face challenges in capturing the intricate relationships within tables and
adapting to the tasks involved. Recent advances in Language Models (LMs),
especially in Large Language Models (LLMs), offer new opportunities to automate
and support tabular data preparation. However, why LMs suit tabular data
preparation (i.e., how their capabilities match task demands) and how to use
them effectively across phases still remain to be systematically explored. In
this survey, we systematically analyze the role of LMs in enhancing tabular
data preparation processes, focusing on four core phases: data acquisition,
integration, cleaning, and transformation. For each phase, we present an
integrated analysis of how LMs can be combined with other components for
different preparation tasks, highlight key advancements, and outline
prospective pipelines.

Motivation: 强化学习在处理复杂时序任务和安全约束时面临挑战，现有方法难以处理嵌套长视野任务及不可行子目标的替代方案。

Method: 利用B\"uchi自动机结构分解LTL任务为子目标序列，采用单步安全强化学习策略，并引入子目标诱导的观测缩减技术降低复杂度。

Conclusion: 通过逐步解决子目标及观测缩减，GenZ-LTL为复杂时序任务提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizing to complex and temporally extended task objectives and safety
constraints remains a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Linear
temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements,
yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested
long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when
a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this
paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to
arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\"uchi
automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid
subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on
subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot
generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a
time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel
subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the
exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic
assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms
existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.

The project enables rich exploration into comparative AI behavior, battle
psychology, and meta-strategy development in constrained, rule-based game

adapt, and optimize decisions under uncertainty, making Pok\'emon League a
novel benchmark for AI research in strategic reasoning and competitive
learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出QCBench基准测试，包含350道计算化学题，分7个子领域和3个难度层级，用于系统评估大语言模型在定量化学中的逐步推理能力。测试19个模型发现性能随复杂度增加而下降，揭示语言流畅性与科学计算精度间的差距。

Motivation: 定量化学在化学研究中至关重要，但大语言模型在严格逐步推理方面的能力尚未充分探索。QCBench旨在填补这一空白，评估模型在真实化学计算任务中的表现。

Method: 构建包含350道计算题的QCBench基准，覆盖7个化学子领域（分析化学、生物/有机化学等），分为基础、中级、专家三级难度，强调逐步数值推理而非捷径。

Result: 对19个大语言模型的评估显示，随着任务复杂度增加，模型性能持续下降，表明当前模型在语言流畅性与科学计算准确性之间存在明显差距。

Conclusion: QCBench可精细诊断模型计算弱点，揭示跨难度级别的特定局限，为未来领域自适应微调或多模态整合改进奠定基础。当前大语言模型尚无法可靠处理复杂定量化学推理。

Abstract: Quantitative chemistry plays a fundamental role in chemistry research,
enabling precise predictions of molecular properties, reaction outcomes, and
material behaviors. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
chemistry-related tasks, their ability to perform rigorous, step-by-step
quantitative reasoning remains underexplored. To fill this blank, we propose
QCBench, a Quantitative Chemistry benchmark comprising 350 computational
chemistry problems across 7 chemistry subfields (analytical chemistry,
bio/organic chemistry, general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical
chemistry, polymer chemistry and quantum chemistry), categorized into three
hierarchical tiers-basic, intermediate, and expert-to systematically evaluate
the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Designed
to minimize shortcuts and emphasize stepwise numerical reasoning, each problem
focuses on pure calculations rooted in real-world chemical vertical fields.
QCBench enables fine-grained diagnosis of computational weaknesses, reveals
model-specific limitations across difficulty levels, and lays the groundwork
for future improvements such as domain adaptive fine-tuning or multi-modal
integration. Evaluations on 19 LLMs demonstrate a consistent performance
degradation with increasing task complexity, highlighting the current gap
between language fluency and scientific computation accuracy.

Conclusion: 建模知识演化对于稳健的长文本问答至关重要，T-GRAG框架通过引入时序感知机制有效解决了现有方法的局限性。代码已公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in natural
language generation but remain limited in knowle-
  dge-intensive tasks due to outdated or incomplete internal knowledge.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external
retrieval, with GraphRAG further enhancing performance through structured
knowledge graphs and multi-hop reasoning. However, existing GraphRAG methods
largely ignore the temporal dynamics of knowledge, leading to issues such as
temporal ambiguity, time-insensitive retrieval, and semantic redundancy. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (T-GRAG), a dynamic,
temporally-aware RAG framework that models the evolution of knowledge over
time. T-GRAG consists of five key components: (1) a Temporal Knowledge Graph
Generator that creates time-stamped, evolving graph structures; (2) a Temporal
Query Decomposition mechanism that breaks complex temporal queries into
manageable sub-queries; (3) a Three-layer Interactive Retriever that
progressively filters and refines retrieval across temporal subgraphs; (4) a
Source Text Extractor to mitigate noise; and (5) a LLM-based Generator that
synthesizes contextually and temporally accurate responses. We also introduce
Time-LongQA, a novel benchmark dataset based on real-world corporate annual
reports, designed to test temporal reasoning across evolving knowledge.
Extensive experiments show that T-GRAG significantly outperforms prior RAG and
GraphRAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response relevance under
temporal constraints, highlighting the necessity of modeling knowledge
evolution for robust long-text question answering. Our code is publicly
available on the T-GRAG

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Automated medical report generation (MRG) holds great promise for reducing
the heavy workload of radiologists. However, its clinical deployment is
hindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty,
caused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction.
Second, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease
prevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions.
Third, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports,
often leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the
reliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these
issues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces
uncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and
contextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair
Resampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects
informative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution
uncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances
the modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting
underrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent
conditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter
validates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the
current image, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Extensive experiments on
the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks demonstrate that SURE-Med achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By holistically reducing uncertainty across
multiple input modalities, SURE-Med sets a new benchmark for reliability in
medical report generation and offers a robust step toward trustworthy clinical
decision support.

Abstract: Although data visualization is powerful for revealing patterns and
communicating insights, creating effective visualizations requires familiarity
with authoring tools and often disrupts the analysis flow. While large language
models show promise for automatically converting analysis intent into
visualizations, existing methods function as black boxes without transparent
reasoning processes, which prevents users from understanding design rationales
and refining suboptimal outputs. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the Natural Language to Visualization
(NL2VIS) pipeline. First, we design a comprehensive CoT reasoning process for
NL2VIS and develop an automatic pipeline to equip existing datasets with
structured reasoning steps. Second, we introduce nvBench-CoT, a specialized
dataset capturing detailed step-by-step reasoning from ambiguous natural
language descriptions to finalized visualizations, which enables
state-of-the-art performance when used for model fine-tuning. Third, we develop
DeepVIS, an interactive visual interface that tightly integrates with the CoT
reasoning process, allowing users to inspect reasoning steps, identify errors,
and make targeted adjustments to improve visualization outcomes. Quantitative
benchmark evaluations, two use cases, and a user study collectively demonstrate
that our CoT framework effectively enhances NL2VIS quality while providing
insightful reasoning steps to users.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (DFJSP) is an NP-hard problem challenged
by real-time event adaptation and complex machine routing. While traditional
dispatching rules are efficient but rigid, deep learning approaches are opaque
and require intricate feature engineering. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise
adaptive reasoning without this engineering overhead, yet we find their direct
application is suboptimal. Baseline LLMs suffer from three key pitfalls: the
long-context paradox, where crucial data is underutilized; an underutilization
of expert heuristics; and myopic decision-making. To address this, we propose
ReflecSched, a framework that empowers the LLM beyond a direct scheduler by
equipping it with a strategic analysis capability. ReflecSched tasks the LLM to
analyze heuristic-driven simulations across multiple planning horizons and
distill them into a concise, natural-language summary termed ``Strategic
Experience''. This summary is then integrated into the prompt of a final
decision-making module, guiding it to produce non-myopic actions. Experiments
show that ReflecSched not only statistically significantly outperforms direct
LLM baselines, securing a 71.35\% Win Rate and a 2.755\% Relative Percentage
Deviation reduction, but also surpasses the performance of all individual
heuristics evaluated, all while demonstrably mitigating the three identified
pitfalls. Additionally, ReflecSched performs on par with the best heuristic
tailored to each instance across all problem cases.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has made the automated
generation of scientific hypotheses that combine novelty, feasibility, and
research value a core challenge. Existing methods based on large language
models fail to systematically model the inherent in hypotheses or incorporate
the closed-loop feedback mechanisms crucial for refinement. This paper proposes
a multi-agent collaborative framework called HypoAgents, which for the first
time integrates Bayesian reasoning with an information entropy-driven search
mechanism across three stages-hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and
hypotheses Refinement-to construct an iterative closed-loop simulating
scientists' cognitive processes. Specifically, the framework first generates an
initial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior
beliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It
then employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature
evidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes'
theorem. Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information
entropy $H = - \sum {{p_i}\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the
iterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and
confidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world
research question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12
optimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves
by 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the
framework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases
significantly by 0.92. This study presents an interpretable probabilistic
reasoning framework for automated scientific discovery, substantially improving
the quality and reliability of machine-generated research hypotheses.

Abstract: Modeling scheduling problems with conditional time intervals and cumulative
functions has become a common approach when using modern commercial constraint
programming solvers. This paradigm enables the modeling of a wide range of
scheduling problems, including those involving producers and consumers.
However, it is unavailable in existing open-source solvers and practical
implementation details remain undocumented. In this work, we present an
implementation of this modeling approach using a single, generic global
constraint called the Generalized Cumulative. We also introduce a novel
time-table filtering algorithm designed to handle tasks defined on conditional
time-intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach, combined
with the new filtering algorithm, performs competitively with existing solvers
enabling the modeling of producer and consumer scheduling problems and
effectively scales to large problems.

Abstract: This paper outlines a general formal framework for reasoning systems,

We model reasoning systems as structured tuples comprising phenomena,
explanation space, inference and generation maps, and a principle base. The
formulation accommodates logical, algorithmic, and learning-based reasoning
processes within a unified structural schema, while remaining agnostic to any
specific reasoning algorithm or logic system. We survey basic internal
criteria--including coherence, soundness, and completeness-and catalog typical
failure modes such as contradiction, incompleteness, and non-convergence. The
framework also admits dynamic behaviors like iterative refinement and principle
evolution. The goal of this work is to establish a foundational structure for
representing and comparing reasoning systems, particularly in contexts where
internal failure, adaptation, or fragmentation may arise. No specific solution
architecture is proposed; instead, we aim to support future theoretical and
practical investigations into reasoning under structural constraint.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex
mathematical reasoning tasks, but they inevitably generate errors throughout
multi-step solutions. Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) have shown great
promise by providing supervision and evaluation at each intermediate step,
thereby effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However,
training effective PRMs requires high-quality process reward data, yet existing
methods for constructing such data are often labour-intensive or inefficient.
In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process
reward data construction, encompassing both data generation and annotation
processes for PRMs. Additionally, we identify the limitations of both majority
vote and PRMs, and introduce two generic uncertainty-aware output aggregation
methods: Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote, which
combine the strengths of majority vote with PRMs. Extensive experiments on
ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus show the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed PRM data construction framework, and demonstrate that the two output
aggregation methods further improve the mathematical reasoning abilities across
diverse PRMs. The code and data will be publicly available at

Abstract: With the rapid development of Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of MCP
servers has surpassed 10,000. However, existing MCP benchmarks are limited to
single-server settings with only a few tools, hindering effective evaluation of
agent capabilities in large-scale, real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, we present LiveMCPBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
comprising 95 real-world tasks grounded in the MCP ecosystem, designed to
evaluate LLM agents at scale across diverse servers. To support a scalable and
reproducible evaluation pipeline in large-scale MCP environments, we curate
LiveMCPTool, a diverse and readily deployable collection of 70 MCP servers and
527 tools. Furthermore, we introduce LiveMCPEval, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework
that enables automated and adaptive evaluation in dynamic, time-varying task
environments, achieving 81% agreement with human reviewers. Finally, we propose
the MCP Copilot Agent, a multi-step agent that routes tools for dynamic
planning and executes tools for API interaction across the entire LiveMCPTool
suite. Our evaluation covers 10 leading models, with the best-performing model
(Claude-Sonnet-4) reaching a 78.95% success rate. However, we observe large
performance variance across models, and several widely-used models perform
poorly in LiveMCPBench's complex, tool-rich environments. Overall, LiveMCPBench
offers the first unified framework for benchmarking LLM agents in realistic,
tool-rich, and dynamic MCP environments, laying a solid foundation for scalable

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in cloud sites remains a critical yet challenging task.
Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high
false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous
events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance
engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and
interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the
first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud
environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual
log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate
detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support
systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that
provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly
behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy
by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on
average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on
anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting.
These results demonstrate the strengths of our approach in improving detection
accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing interpretability, thereby
supporting practical deployment in enterprise cloud environments.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) excel at general NLP tasks but often
lack domain specific precision in professional settings. Building a high
quality domain specific multi turn dialogue dataset is essential for developing
specialized conversational systems. However, existing methods such as manual
annotation, simulated human LLM interactions, and role based LLM dialogues are
resource intensive or suffer from limitations in dialogue quality and domain
coverage. To address these challenges, we introduce ProKG Dial, a progressive
framework for constructing knowledge intensive multi turn dialogue datasets
using domain specific knowledge graphs (KGs). ProKG Dial leverages the
structured nature of KGs to encode complex domain knowledge and relationships,
providing a solid foundation for generating meaningful and coherent dialogues.
Specifically, ProKG Dial begins by applying community detection to partition
the KG into semantically cohesive subgraphs. For each subgraph, the framework
incrementally generates a series of questions and answers centered around a
target entity, ensuring relevance and coverage. A rigorous filtering step is
employed to maintain high dialogue quality. We validate ProKG Dial on a medical
knowledge graph by evaluating the generated dialogues in terms of diversity,
semantic coherence, and entity coverage. Furthermore, we fine tune a base LLM
on the resulting dataset and benchmark it against several baselines. Both
automatic metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that ProKG Dial

Abstract: In recent years, research on transforming natural language into graph query
language (NL2GQL) has been increasing. Most existing methods focus on
single-turn transformation from NL to GQL. In practical applications, user
interactions with graph databases are typically multi-turn, dynamic, and
context-dependent. While single-turn methods can handle straightforward
queries, more complex scenarios often require users to iteratively adjust their
queries, investigate the connections between entities, or request additional
details across multiple dialogue turns. Research focused on single-turn
conversion fails to effectively address multi-turn dialogues and complex
context dependencies. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality multi-turn
NL2GQL datasets further hinders the progress of this field. To address this
challenge, we propose an automated method for constructing multi-turn NL2GQL
datasets based on Large Language Models (LLMs) , and apply this method to
develop the MTGQL dataset, which is constructed from a financial market graph
database and will be publicly released for future research. Moreover, we
propose three types of baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of
multi-turn NL2GQL translation, thereby laying a solid foundation for future
research.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich unstructured clinical notes
that could enhance predictive modeling, yet extracting meaningful features from
these notes remains challenging. Current approaches range from labor-intensive
manual clinician feature generation (CFG) to fully automated representational
feature generation (RFG) that lack interpretability and clinical relevance.
Here we introduce SNOW (Scalable Note-to-Outcome Workflow), a modular
multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) that autonomously
generates structured clinical features from unstructured notes without human
intervention. We evaluated SNOW against manual CFG, clinician-guided LLM
approaches, and RFG methods for predicting 5-year prostate cancer recurrence in
147 patients from Stanford Healthcare. While manual CFG achieved the highest
performance (AUC-ROC: 0.771), SNOW matched this performance (0.761) without
requiring any clinical expertise, significantly outperforming both baseline
features alone (0.691) and all RFG approaches. The clinician-guided LLM method
also performed well (0.732) but still required expert input. SNOW's specialized
agents handle feature discovery, extraction, validation, post-processing, and
aggregation, creating interpretable features that capture complex clinical
information typically accessible only through manual review. Our findings
demonstrate that autonomous LLM systems can replicate expert-level feature
engineering at scale, potentially transforming how clinical ML models leverage
unstructured EHR data while maintaining the interpretability essential for
clinical deployment.

Abstract: We propose AMADEUS, which is composed of Adaptive Context-aware Text Splitter
(ACTS), Guided Selection (GS), and Attribute Extractor (AE). ACTS finds an
optimal chunk length and hierarchical contexts for each character. AE
identifies a character's general attributes from the chunks retrieved by GS and
uses these attributes as a final context to maintain robust persona consistency
even when answering out of knowledge questions. To facilitate the development
and evaluation of RAG-based RPAs, we construct CharacterRAG, a role-playing
dataset that consists of persona documents for 15 distinct fictional characters
totaling 976K written characters, and 450 question and answer pairs. We find
that our framework effectively models not only the knowledge possessed by
characters, but also various attributes such as personality.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned to align with human values often
exhibit alignment drift, producing unsafe or policy-violating completions when
exposed to adversarial prompts, decoding perturbations, or paraphrased
jailbreaks. While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure,
little is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these
failures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe
completions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central
to our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic
inconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved
training documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary
interventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses
completions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a
contrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,
and (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam
expansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce
alignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)
while preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and
improved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift
likelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and
length to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first
scalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating
alignment failures at source. To encourage further exploration and development,
we open-source our implementation at:

Abstract: The goal of construction site risk and hazard identification is to enhance
safety management through automation. Existing research based on large language
models falls into two categories: image-text matching for collaborative
reasoning, which struggles with complex hazard features, and instruction
fine-tuning or dialogue guidance using professional datasets, which suffers
from high training costs and poor generalization.To address this, we propose a
hazard identification method using similar case retrieval enhancement. By
integrating external knowledge and retrieved case contexts via prompt
fine-tuning, we mitigate misjudgments caused by limited domain knowledge and
weak feature associations. Our method includes three modules: retrieval
library, image similarity retrieval, and large model retrieval enhancement,
enabling efficient recognition without training. Experiments on real
construction data show significant improvements. For instance, GLM-4V's
recognition accuracy increased to 50\%, a 35.49\% boost. The method enhances
accuracy, context understanding, and stability, offering new theoretical and
technical support for hazard detection.

Abstract: Coordinating multiple large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks
collaboratively poses a fundamental trade-off between the computation costs and
collective performance compared with individual model. We introduce a novel,
game-theoretically grounded reinforcement learning (RL) framework, the
Multi-Agent Cooperation Sequential Public Goods Game (MAC-SPGG), to
systematically incentivize cooperation in multi-LLM ensembles. In MAC-SPGG, LLM
agents move in sequence, observing predecessors' outputs and updating beliefs
to condition their own contributions. By redesigning the public-goods reward,
effortful contributions become the unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium
(SPNE), which eliminates free-riding under traditional SPGG or PGG. Its
sequential protocol replaces costly round-based information exchanges with a
streamlined decision flow, cutting communication overhead while retaining
strategic depth. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SPNE under
realistic parameters, and empirically show that MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles
outperform single-agent baselines, chain-of-thought prompting, and other
cooperative methods, even achieving comparable performance to large-scale
models across reasoning, math, code generation, and NLP tasks. Our results
highlight the power of structured, incentive-aligned MAC-SPGG cooperation for
scalable and robust multi-agent language generation.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive
capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with
their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated
tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory
leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain
rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving
problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they
ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of
search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To
address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that
enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach
revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:
revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables
two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by
intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,
and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance
performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through
these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that
incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench
Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five
strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative
improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source
agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly
available at https://github.com/wanghuacan/SE-Agent.

Abstract: Imagine a child sketching the Eiffel Tower and asking a robot to bring it to
life. Today's robot manipulation systems can't act on such sketches
directly-they require precise 3D block poses as goals, which in turn demand
structural analysis and expert tools like CAD. We present StackItUp, a system
that enables non-experts to specify complex 3D structures using only 2D
front-view hand-drawn sketches. StackItUp introduces an abstract relation graph
to bridge the gap between rough sketches and accurate 3D block arrangements,
capturing the symbolic geometric relations (e.g., left-of) and stability
patterns (e.g., two-pillar-bridge) while discarding noisy metric details from
sketches. It then grounds this graph to 3D poses using compositional diffusion
models and iteratively updates it by predicting hidden internal and rear
supports-critical for stability but absent from the sketch. Evaluated on
sketches of iconic landmarks and modern house designs, StackItUp consistently
produces stable, multilevel 3D structures and outperforms all baselines in both
stability and visual resemblance.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in complex reasoning and decision-making by leveraging external tools. However,
this tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack
surface: adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names,
descriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify
this as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be
preferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or
access to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we
propose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning
framework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically
valid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates
seamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the
agent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic,
simulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate
consistently high attack success rates (81\%-95\%) and significant privacy
leakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack
remains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured
tool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic
vulnerabilities in current agent architectures. These findings reveal that
metadata manipulation constitutes a potent and stealthy attack surface,
highlighting the need for execution-level security mechanisms that go beyond
prompt-level defenses.

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have gradually become a research
hotspot due to their outstanding performance in handling complex tasks. Among
them, DeepSeek R1 has garnered significant attention for its exceptional
performance and open-source nature, driving advancements in the research of
R1-style LRMs. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), these models
enhance logical deduction and decision-making capabilities during reasoning by
incorporating mechanisms such as long chain-of-thought and self-reflection
through reinforcement learning. However, with the widespread application of
these models, the problem of overthinking has gradually emerged. Specifically,
when generating answers, these models often construct excessively long
reasoning chains with redundant or repetitive steps, which leads to reduced
reasoning efficiency and may affect the accuracy of the final answer. To this
end, various efficient reasoning methods have been proposed, aiming to reduce
the length of reasoning paths without compromising model performance and
reasoning capability. By reviewing the current research advancements in the
field of efficient reasoning methods systematically, we categorize existing
works into two main directions based on the lens of single-model optimization
versus model collaboration: (1) Efficient Reasoning with Single Model, which
focuses on improving the reasoning efficiency of individual models; and (2)
Efficient Reasoning with Model Collaboration, which explores optimizing
reasoning paths through collaboration among multiple models. Besides, we
maintain a public GitHub repository that tracks the latest progress in
efficient reasoning methods.

Abstract: As the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to
advance, LLM-based agent systems offer advantages in flexibility and
interpretability over traditional systems, garnering increasing attention.
However, despite the widespread research interest and industrial application of
agent systems, these systems, like their traditional counterparts, frequently
encounter anomalies. These anomalies lead to instability and insecurity,
hindering their further development. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic
approach to the operation and maintenance of agent systems is urgently needed.
Unfortunately, current research on the operations of agent systems is sparse.
To address this gap, we have undertaken a survey on agent system operations
with the aim of establishing a clear framework for the field, defining the
challenges, and facilitating further development. Specifically, this paper
begins by systematically defining anomalies within agent systems, categorizing
them into intra-agent anomalies and inter-agent anomalies. Next, we introduce a
novel and comprehensive operational framework for agent systems, dubbed Agent
System Operations (AgentOps). We provide detailed definitions and explanations
of its four key stages: monitoring, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and
resolution.

Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is constantly
increasing, but the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention
mechanism often becomes a bottleneck. Although existing sparse attention
mechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as
static patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask
sparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes
content-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key
innovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from
value representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical
information adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention
computation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This
dual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational
complexity of important information while retaining complete information,
achieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational
efficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive
experiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head
attention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native
sparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings.
Moreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also
demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods.
Crucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly
outperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the
challenging needle-in-a-haystack task. These experimental results highlight its
capability to balance model efficiency and long-context modeling ability
effectively.

Abstract: The emotional arc is a universal narrative structure underlying stories
across cultures and media -- an idea central to structuralist narratology,
often encapsulated in the phrase "all stories are one story." We present a
framework for procedural game narrative generation that incorporates emotional
arcs as a structural backbone for both story progression and gameplay dynamics.
Leveraging established narratological theories and large-scale empirical
analyses, we focus on two core emotional patterns -- Rise and Fall -- to guide
the generation of branching story graphs. Each story node is automatically
populated with characters, items, and gameplay-relevant attributes (e.g.,
health, attack), with difficulty adjusted according to the emotional
trajectory. Implemented in a prototype action role-playing game (ARPG), our
system demonstrates how emotional arcs can be operationalized using large
language models (LLMs) and adaptive entity generation. Evaluation through
player ratings, interviews, and sentiment analysis shows that emotional arc
integration significantly enhances engagement, narrative coherence, and
emotional impact. These results highlight the potential of emotionally
structured procedural generation for advancing interactive storytelling for
games.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often produce excessively verbose reasoning
traces, a phenomenon known as overthinking, which hampers both efficiency and
interpretability. Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response
length, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the
reasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it
into two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of
low-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and
external redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To
mitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning
framework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis
to penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the
correct answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the
FCS to encourage earlier termination. Our method significantly compresses
reasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, and generalizes effectively to
out-of-domain tasks such as question answering and code generation. Crucially,
we find that external redundancy can be safely removed without degrading
performance, whereas internal redundancy must be reduced more cautiously to
avoid impairing correctness. These findings suggest that our method not only
improves reasoning efficiency but also enables implicit, semantic-aware control
over Chain-of-Thought length, paving the way for more concise and interpretable
LRMs.

Abstract: Despite remarkable capabilities, artificial neural networks exhibit limited

fundamental divergence from biological cognition that overlooks both neural
regions' functional specialization and the temporal dynamics critical for
coordinating these specialized systems. We propose a tripartite brain-inspired
architecture comprising functionally specialized perceptual, auxiliary, and
executive systems. Moreover, the integration of temporal dynamics through the
simulation of multi-frequency neural oscillation and synaptic dynamic
adaptation mechanisms enhances the architecture, thereby enabling more flexible
and efficient artificial cognition. Initial evaluations demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art temporal processing approaches, with
2.18\% accuracy improvements while reducing required computation iterations by
48.44\%, and achieving higher correlation with human confidence patterns.
Though currently demonstrated on visual processing tasks, this architecture
establishes a theoretical foundation for brain-like intelligence across
cognitive domains, potentially bridging the gap between artificial and
biological intelligence.

minimization with epistemic priors, we transform a combinatorial search problem
into a tractable inference problem solvable through standard variational
techniques. Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space
models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on
environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially
observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform
conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and
efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld
environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially
observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking.
This approach bridges active inference theory with practical implementations,
providing empirical evidence for the efficiency of epistemic priors in
artificial agents.

Abstract: The manual design of scenarios for Air Traffic Control (ATC) training is a
demanding and time-consuming bottleneck that limits the diversity of
simulations available to controllers. To address this, we introduce a novel,
end-to-end approach, AirTrafficGen, that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to automate and control the generation of complex ATC scenarios. Our method
uses a purpose-built, graph-based representation to encode sector topology
(including airspace geometry, routes, and fixes) into a format LLMs can
process. Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 can generate high-traffic scenarios whilst
maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained
control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest
these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed
scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable
alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume
and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work
showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical
domains.

Abstract: Financial AI holds great promise for transforming modern finance, with the
potential to support a wide range of tasks such as market forecasting,
portfolio management, quantitative trading, and automated analysis. However,
existing platforms remain limited in task coverage, lack robust multimodal data
integration, and offer insufficient support for the training and deployment of
large language models (LLMs). In response to these limitations, we present
FinWorld, an all-in-one open-source platform that provides end-to-end support
for the entire financial AI workflow, from data acquisition to experimentation
and deployment. FinWorld distinguishes itself through native integration of
heterogeneous financial data, unified support for diverse AI paradigms, and
advanced agent automation, enabling seamless development and deployment.
Leveraging data from 2 representative markets, 4 stock pools, and over 800
million financial data points, we conduct comprehensive experiments on 4 key
financial AI tasks. These experiments systematically evaluate deep learning and
reinforcement learning algorithms, with particular emphasis on RL-based
finetuning for LLMs and LLM Agents. The empirical results demonstrate that
FinWorld significantly enhances reproducibility, supports transparent

Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is vital for mitigating congestion and
sustaining urban mobility. In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation
model with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through
self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with
expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers
three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot
generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and
out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control
policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is
lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling
large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC
process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its
self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive
benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art,
outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In
practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily,
shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload. Our
checkpoint is available at https://huggingface.co/Season998/Traffic-R1.

Abstract: Composable AI offers a scalable and effective paradigm for tackling complex
AI tasks by decomposing them into sub-tasks and solving each sub-task using
ready-to-use well-trained models. However, systematically evaluating methods
under this setting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce
CABENCH, the first public benchmark comprising 70 realistic composable AI
tasks, along with a curated pool of 700 models across multiple modalities and
domains. We also propose an evaluation framework to enable end-to-end
assessment of composable AI solutions. To establish initial baselines, we
provide human-designed reference solutions and compare their performance with
two LLM-based approaches. Our results illustrate the promise of composable AI
in addressing complex real-world problems while highlighting the need for
methods that can fully unlock its potential by automatically generating
effective execution pipelines.

Abstract: Multimodal Affective Computing (MAC) aims to recognize and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from diverse modalities such as text,
video, and audio. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have significantly reshaped the landscape of MAC by offering a unified
framework for processing and aligning cross-modal information. However,
practical challenges remain, including performance variability across complex
MAC tasks and insufficient understanding of how architectural designs and data
characteristics impact affective analysis. To address these gaps, we conduct a
systematic benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs capable
of concurrently processing audio, visual, and textual modalities across
multiple established MAC datasets. Our evaluation not only compares the
performance of these MLLMs but also provides actionable insights into model
optimization by analyzing the influence of model architectures and dataset
properties. Furthermore, we propose a novel hybrid strategy that combines
generative knowledge prompting with supervised fine-tuning to enhance MLLMs'
affective computing capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that this
integrated approach significantly improves performance across various MAC
tasks, offering a promising avenue for future research and development in this
field. Our code is released on https://github.com/LuoMSen/MLLM-MAC.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence, large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in industrial domains, offering
new opportunities for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). These models
help address challenges such as high development costs, long deployment cycles,
and limited generalizability. However, despite the growing synergy between PHM
and LLMs, existing evaluation methodologies often fall short in structural
completeness, dimensional comprehensiveness, and evaluation granularity. This
hampers the in-depth integration of LLMs into the PHM domain. To address these
limitations, this study proposes PHM-Bench, a novel three-dimensional
evaluation framework for PHM-oriented large models. Grounded in the triadic
structure of fundamental capability, core task, and entire lifecycle, PHM-Bench
is tailored to the unique demands of PHM system engineering. It defines
multi-level evaluation metrics spanning knowledge comprehension, algorithmic
generation, and task optimization. These metrics align with typical PHM tasks,
including condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, RUL prediction, and
maintenance decision-making. Utilizing both curated case sets and publicly
available industrial datasets, our study enables multi-dimensional evaluation
of general-purpose and domain-specific models across diverse PHM tasks.
PHM-Bench establishes a methodological foundation for large-scale assessment of
LLMs in PHM and offers a critical benchmark to guide the transition from
general-purpose to PHM-specialized models.

Abstract: LLM-based solvers have emerged as a promising means of automating problem
modeling and solving. However, they remain unreliable and often depend on
iterative repair loops that result in significant latency. We introduce
OptiHive, an LLM-based framework that produces high-quality solvers for
optimization problems from natural-language descriptions without iterative
self-correction. OptiHive uses a single batched LLM query to generate diverse
components (solvers, problem instances, and validation tests) and filters out
erroneous components to ensure fully interpretable outputs. Taking into account
the imperfection of the generated components, we employ a statistical model to
infer their true performance, enabling principled uncertainty quantification
and solver selection. On tasks ranging from traditional optimization problems
to challenging variants of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem, OptiHive
significantly outperforms baselines, increasing the optimality rate from 5\% to
92\% on the most complex problems.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model
(LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought
(CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing
evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by
excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive
reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely
on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which
regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To
address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt
Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate
reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How
module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This
allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be
seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability
and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets
demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination,
yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of postmenstrual age (PMA) at scan is crucial for
assessing neonatal development and health. While deep learning models have
achieved high accuracy in predicting PMA from brain MRI, they often function as
black boxes, offering limited transparency and interpretability in clinical
decision support. In this work, we address the dual challenge of accuracy and
interpretability by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to
perform both precise PMA prediction and clinically relevant explanation
generation. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy
using instruction tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) applied to the
Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. The model is trained on four 2D cortical surface
projection maps derived from neonatal MRI scans. By employing distinct prompts
for training and inference, our approach enables the MLLM to handle a
regression task during training and generate clinically relevant explanations
during inference. The fine-tuned model achieves a low prediction error with a
95 percent confidence interval of 0.78 to 1.52 weeks, while producing
interpretable outputs grounded in developmental features, marking a significant
step toward transparent and trustworthy AI systems in perinatal neuroscience.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a
wide range of tasks, yet they still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, a challenge fundamentally rooted in deep structural dependencies. To
address this challenge, we propose \textbf{CA}usal \textbf{MA}thematician
(\textbf{CAMA}), a two-stage causal framework that equips LLMs with explicit,
reusable mathematical structure. In the learning stage, CAMA first constructs
the \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{G}raph (\textbf{MCG}), a
high-level representation of solution strategies, by combining LLM priors with
causal discovery algorithms applied to a corpus of question-solution pairs. The
resulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies.
To better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines
the MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the
question-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA
dynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both
the question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph,
which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal
dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning
process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly
improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms
unstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal
relationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations
alone.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Abstract: This paper introduces and formalizes Noosemia, a novel
cognitive-phenomenological phenomenon emerging from human interaction with
generative AI systems, particularly those enabling dialogic or multimodal
exchanges. We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under
certain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even
interiority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance,
but in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological
complexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical
notion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct
meaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the
human-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia,
animism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its
unique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the
phenomenological withdrawal of such projections. The paper concludes with
reflections on the broader philosophical, epistemological, and social
implications of noosemic dynamics and directions for future research.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations study what should have changed in order to get an
alternative result, enabling end-users to understand machine learning
mechanisms with counterexamples. Actionability is defined as the ability to
transform the original case to be explained into a counterfactual one. We
develop a method for actionable counterfactual explanations that, unlike
predecessors, does not directly leverage training data. Rather, data is only
used to learn a density estimator, creating a search landscape in which to
apply path planning algorithms to solve the problem and masking the endogenous
data, which can be sensitive or private. We put special focus on estimating the
data density using Bayesian networks, demonstrating how their enhanced
interpretability is useful in high-stakes scenarios in which fairness is
raising concern. Using a synthetic benchmark comprised of 15 datasets, our
proposal finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals than the current
state-of-the-art algorithms. We also test our algorithm with a real-world
Environmental Protection Agency dataset, facilitating a more efficient and
equitable study of policies to improve the quality of life in United States of
America counties. Our proposal captures the interaction of variables, ensuring
equity in decisions, as policies to improve certain domains of study (air,
water quality, etc.) can be detrimental in others. In particular, the
sociodemographic domain is often involved, where we find important variables
related to the ongoing housing crisis that can potentially have a severe
negative impact on communities.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Diffusion policies excel at robotic manipulation by naturally modeling
multimodal action distributions in high-dimensional spaces. Nevertheless,
diffusion policies suffer from diffusion representation collapse: semantically
similar observations are mapped to indistinguishable features, ultimately
impairing their ability to handle subtle but critical variations required for
complex robotic manipulation. To address this problem, we propose D2PPO
(Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss). D2PPO introduces
dispersive loss regularization that combats representation collapse by treating
all hidden representations within each batch as negative pairs. D2PPO compels
the network to learn discriminative representations of similar observations,
thereby enabling the policy to identify subtle yet crucial differences
necessary for precise manipulation. In evaluation, we find that early-layer
regularization benefits simple tasks, while late-layer regularization sharply
enhances performance on complex manipulation tasks. On RoboMimic benchmarks,
D2PPO achieves an average improvement of 22.7% in pre-training and 26.1% after
fine-tuning, setting new SOTA results. In comparison with SOTA, results of
real-world experiments on a Franka Emika Panda robot show the excitingly high
success rate of our method. The superiority of our method is especially evident
in complex tasks. Project page: https://guowei-zou.github.io/d2ppo/
