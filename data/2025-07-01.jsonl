The names of these\ntwo layouts derive from the fact that, when parsing the graph according to the\nlinear vertex ordering, the edges in a single page can be stored using a single\nstack or queue, respectively. Recently, the concepts of stack and queue layouts\nhave been extended by using a double-ended queue or a restricted-input queue\nfor storing the edges of a page. We extend this line of study to edge-weighted\ngraphs by introducing priority queue layouts, that is, the edges on each page\nare stored in a priority queue whose keys are the edge weights. First, we show\nthat there are edge-weighted graphs that require a linear number of priority\nqueues. Second, we characterize the graphs that admit a priority queue layout\nwith a single queue, regardless of the edge-weight function, and we provide an\nefficient recognition algorithm. Third, we show that the number of priority\nqueues required independently of the edge-weight function is bounded by the\npathwidth of the graph, but can be arbitrarily large already for graphs of\ntreewidth two.

Such a result\nwas proven originally by [Demaine & Hajiaghayi, Combinatorica, 2008], where $f$\nwas indeed linear in $k$. However the dependency in $t$ in this result was\nnon-explicit (and huge). Later, [Kawarabayashi & Kobayashi, JCTB, 2020] showed\nthat this bound can be estimated to be $f(t,k)\\in 2^{\\mathcal{O}(t\\log t)}\n\\cdot k$. Wood recently asked whether $f$ can be pushed further to be\npolynomial, while maintaining the linearity on $k$. We answer this in a\nparticularly strong sense, by showing that the treewidth/branchwidth of $G$ is\nin $\\mathcal{O}(gk + t^{2304}),$ where $g$ is the Euler genus of $H$. This\ndirectly yields $f(t,k)= \\mathcal{O}(t^2k + t^{2304})$.\n  Our methods build on techniques for branchwidth and on new bounds and\ninsights for the Graph Minor Structure Theorem (GMST) due to [Gorsky, Seweryn &\nWiederrecht, 2025, arXiv:2504.02532].

This study investigates the ability of LLMs to simulate\nrisky decision-making scenarios.

We prove that the answer to this Inverse Fleet Assignment Problem\nis 'yes' for myopic fleet strategies which are more 'selfish' than\n'altruistic', and 'no' otherwise, under mild assumptions on route/link\nperformance functions. To reach these conclusions we introduce the forward\nfleet assignment operator and study its properties, proving that it is\ninvertible for 'bad' objectives of fleet controllers. We also discuss the\nchallenges of implementing myopic fleet routing in the real world and compare\nit to Stackelberg and Nash routing. Finally, we show that optimal Stackelberg\nfleet routing could involve highly variable mixed strategies in some scenarios,\nwhich would likely cause chaos in the traffic network."}

In this paper, we examine the challenge of\ncostly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide\nwhether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize\ndefection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional\nchoice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs\nnavigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions.

Ensuring robust encryption for sensitive\ninformation is critical for systems' compliance with security standards.\nAlthough holistic database encryption provides strong protection, existing\ndatabase systems often require a complete backup and restore cycle, resulting\nin prolonged downtime and increased storage usage. This makes it difficult to\nimplement online encryption techniques in high-throughput environments without\ndisrupting critical operations.\n  To address this challenge, we envision a solution that enables online\ndatabase encryption aligned with system activity, eliminating the need for\ndowntime, storage overhead, or full-database reprocessing. Central to this\nvision is the ability to predict which parts of the database will be accessed\nnext, allowing encryption to be applied online. As a step towards this\nsolution, this study proposes a predictive approach that leverages deep\nlearning models to forecast database lock sequences, using IBM Db2 as the\ndatabase system under study. In this study, we collected a specialized dataset\nfrom TPC-C benchmark workloads, leveraging lock event logs for model training\nand evaluation. We applied deep learning architectures, such as Transformer and\nLSTM, to evaluate models for various table-level and page-level lock\npredictions. We benchmark the accuracy of the trained models versus a Naive\nBaseline across different prediction horizons and timelines.\n  The study experiments demonstrate that the proposed deep learning-based\nmodels achieve up to 49% average accuracy for table-level and 66% for\npage-level predictions, outperforming a Naive Baseline. By anticipating which\ntables and pages will be locked next, the proposed approach is a step toward\nonline encryption, offering a practical path toward secure, low-overhead\ndatabase systems."}

We\npropose specialized metrics for evaluating both attack effectiveness and\ndefense performance, addressing the specific challenges of generative language\nmodels. Through our analysis, we identify critical limitations in current\napproaches and propose promising research directions, including integrated\nattack methodologies and adaptive defense mechanisms that balance security with\nmodel utility.

IESs already excel\nin treating IP in practice, but accomplish it via discretization and by\napplying sophisticated patches to their continuous operators, while\npersistently using the $\\ell_2$-norm as their operation pillar. We lay\nfoundations for discrete search, by adopting the $\\ell_1$-norm, accounting for\nthe suitable step-size, and questioning alternative measures to quantify\ncorrelations over the integer lattice. We focus on mutation distributions for\nunbounded integer decision variables. We briefly discuss a couple of candidate\ndiscrete probabilities induced by the uniform and binomial distributions, which\nwe show to possess less appealing theoretical properties, and then narrow down\nto the Truncated Normal (TN) and Double Geometric (DG) distributions. We\nexplore their theoretical properties, including entropy functions, and propose\na procedure to generate scalable correlated mutation distributions. Our\ninvestigations are accompanied by extensive numerical simulations, which\nconsistently support the claim that the DG distribution is better suited for\nunbounded integer search. We link our theoretical perspective to empirical\nevidence indicating that an IES with correlated DG mutations outperformed other\nstrategies over non-separable quadratic IP. We conclude that while the\nreplacement of the default TN distribution by the DG is theoretically justified\nand practically beneficial, the truly crucial change lies in adopting the\n$\\ell_1$-norm over the $\\ell_2$-norm."}

Second, an adversarial\ninput, whether a perturbed sample in AE attacks or a trigger-carrying sample in\nbackdoor attacks, exhibits distinctive trajectory signatures from a benign\nsample as it propagates through the layers of a DL model in forward inference.\nThe propagation trajectory of the adversarial sample must deviate from that of\nits benign counterpart; otherwise, the adversarial objective cannot be\nfulfilled.

Despite this interest, the empirical study of these methods is\nhindered by the lack of publicly available data. Reliable empirical analysis of\nthe privacy properties of an API, in fact, requires access to a dataset\nconsisting of realistic API outputs; however, privacy concerns prevent the\ngeneral release of such data to the public.\n  In this work, we develop a novel methodology to construct synthetic API\noutputs that are simultaneously realistic enough to enable accurate study and\nprovide strong privacy protections. We focus on one Privacy-Preserving Ads\nAPIs: the Topics API, part of Google Chrome's Privacy Sandbox. We developed a\nmethodology to generate a differentially-private dataset that closely matches\nthe re-identification risk properties of the real Topics API data. The use of\ndifferential privacy provides strong theoretical bounds on the leakage of\nprivate user information from this release.\n  Our methodology is based on first computing a large number of\ndifferentially-private statistics describing how output API traces evolve over\ntime. Then, we design a parameterized distribution over sequences of API traces\nand optimize its parameters so that they closely match the statistics obtained.\nFinally, we create the synthetic data by drawing from this distribution.\n  Our work is complemented by an open-source release of the anonymized dataset\nobtained by this methodology.
