However, ensuring\ntrustworthiness in web-based tokenized ecosystems poses significant challenges,\nfrom verifying off-chain asset data to enforcing regulatory compliance. This\npaper proposes an AI-governed agent architecture that integrates intelligent\nagents with blockchain to achieve web-trustworthy tokenization of alternative\nassets. In the proposed architecture, autonomous agents orchestrate the\ntokenization process (asset verification, valuation, compliance checking, and\nlifecycle management), while an AI-driven governance layer monitors agent\nbehavior and enforces trust through adaptive policies and cryptoeconomic\nincentives. We demonstrate that this approach enhances transparency, security,\nand compliance in asset tokenization, addressing key concerns around data\nauthenticity and fraud. A case study on tokenizing real estate assets\nillustrates how the architecture mitigates risks (e.g., fraudulent listings and\nmoney laundering) through real-time AI anomaly detection and on-chain\nenforcement. Our evaluation and analysis suggest that combining AI governance\nwith multi-agent systems and blockchain can significantly bolster trust in\ntokenized asset ecosystems. This work offers a novel framework for trustworthy\nasset tokenization on the web and provides insights for practitioners aiming to\ndeploy secure, compliant tokenization platforms."}

Since density ratios may not exist in these\nsettings, standard transfer learning techniques often fail to leverage such\nstructure.

The Stealtooth attack leverages\nthe fact that Bluetooth audio devices automatically transition to pairing mode\nunder specific conditions, enabling attackers to hijack pairing processes\nwithout user awareness or specialized tools.
