For every point set we define a corresponding Radon polytope,\nwhich encodes all information about Radon partitions of our set - with Radon\npartitions corresponding to faces of the polytope. This allows us to derive\nexpressions for the probability that a given partition of $N$ randomly chosen\npoints in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ forms a Radon partition. These expressions involve\nconic kinematic formulas and intrinsic volumes, and in general require repeated\nintegration, though we obtain closed formulas in some cases. This framework can\nprovide new perspectives on open problems that can be formulated in terms of\nRadon partitions, such as Reay's relaxed Tverberg conjecture."}

Given a first-order method, a function class, and a noise\nmodel with prescribed expectation and variance properties, we present a range\nof semidefinite programs (SDPs) of increasingly large size, whose solutions\nyield increasingly strong convergence guarantees on the problem. Eventually, we\npropose SDPs whose size depends on $2^N$, with $N$ the number of iterations\nanalyzed, that yield tight guarantees, attained by specific functions and noise\ndistributions within these classes. On the other side of the spectrum, we\npropose SDPs whose size depends linearly on $N$, and numerically show that, on\nmany problems, they already provide tight guarantees.\n  The framework accommodates a wide range of stochastic settings, with finite\nor infinite support, including the unstructured noise model with bounded\nvariance, finite-sum optimization, and block-coordinate methods, in a unified\nmanner, as guarantees apply to any setting consistent with the noise model,\ni.e., its expectation and variance. It covers both non-variance-reduced and\nvariance-reduced methods. Using the framework, we analyze the stochastic\ngradient method under several noise models, and illustrate how the resulting\nnumerical and analytical convergence rates connect with existing results. In\nparticular, we provide improved convergence rates on the unstructured noise\nmodel with bounded variance and in the block-coordinate setting."}

While this\nhas recently been resolved for pathwidth, the case of treewidth remains open,\nand prior work has reduced the problem to understanding the layered-wheel-like\nobstructions -- graphs that contain large complete minor models with each\nbranching set inducing a path; exclude large walls as induced minors; exclude\nlarge complete bipartite graphs as induced minors; and exclude large complete\nsubgraphs.\n  There are various constructions of such graphs, but they are all rather\ninvolved. In this paper, we present a simple construction of layered-wheel-like\ngraphs with arbitrarily large treewidth. Three notable features of our\nconstruction are: (a) the vertices of degree at least four can be made to be\narbitrarily far apart; (b) the girth can be made to be arbitrarily large; and\n(c) every outerstring induced subgraph of the graphs from our construction has\ntreewidth bounded by an absolute constant. In contrast, among several\npreviously known constructions of layered wheels, none achieves (a); at most\none satisfies either (b) or (c); and none satisfies both (b) and (c)\nsimultaneously.\n  In particular, this is related to a former conjecture of Trotignon, that\nevery graph with large enough treewidth, excluding large walls and large\ncomplete bipartite graphs as induced minors, and large complete subgraphs, must\ncontain an outerstring induced subgraph of large treewidth. Our construction\nprovides the first counterexample to this conjecture that can also be made to\nhave arbitrarily large girth."}

To enable a\nuser-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study\nproposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous\ndescriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT)\nresults, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or\nring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS)\nsoftware and traffic signal controllers.

Based on LLM outputs, python\nscripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic\nsignal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan.\nWithin a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan\nediting. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of\nover 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300\nplan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of\nunderstanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an\neasy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers,\nserving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile\napplication of LLMs in the field of ITS.

Our analysis naturally yields an exact algorithm, numerically\nup to machine precision, that is amenable to computing regularization paths and\nvery fast.

However, the\ncommon lack of disclosure regarding their usage raises significant privacy and\ncopyright concerns. Dataset auditing techniques, which aim to determine if a\nspecific dataset was used to train a given suspicious model, provide promising\nsolutions to addressing these transparency gaps. While prior work has developed\nvarious auditing methods, their resilience against dedicated adversarial\nattacks remains largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, this paper initiates a\ncomprehensive study evaluating dataset auditing from an adversarial\nperspective. We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing\nmethods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the\ndata) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing).\nSubsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed\nto conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely\nimplicate an unused dataset. Building on the understanding of existing methods\nand attack objectives, we further propose systematic attack strategies:\ndecoupling, removal, and detection for evasion; adversarial example-based\nmethods for forgery. These formulations and strategies lead to our new\nbenchmark, DATABench, comprising 17 evasion attacks, 5 forgery attacks, and 9\nrepresentative auditing methods. Extensive evaluations using DATABench reveal\nthat none of the evaluated auditing methods are sufficiently robust or\ndistinctive under adversarial settings. These findings underscore the urgent\nneed for developing a more secure and reliable dataset auditing method capable\nof withstanding sophisticated adversarial manipulation.

Previous studies have\nisolated LLM jailbreak attacks and defenses. We analyze the security protection\nmechanism of the LLM, and propose a framework that combines attack and defense.\nOur method is based on the linearly separable property of LLM intermediate\nlayer embedding, as well as the essence of jailbreak attack, which aims to\nembed harmful problems and transfer them to the safe area. We utilize\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the security judgment boundary\ninside the LLM to achieve efficient jailbreak attack and defense. The\nexperimental results indicate that our method achieves an average jailbreak\nsuccess rate of 88.85\\% across three popular LLMs, while the defense success\nrate on the state-of-the-art jailbreak dataset reaches an average of 84.17\\%.\nThis not only validates the effectiveness of our approach but also sheds light\non the internal security mechanisms of LLMs, offering new insights for\nenhancing model security The code and data are available at\nhttps://github.com/NLPGM/CAVGAN."}

This study\ncompares plans from human experts and two AI models (a generalist and a\nreasoner), assessed by both human peers and a superior AI judge.\n  Methods: Ten dermatologists, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI\n(o3) generated treatment plans for five complex dermatology cases. The\nanonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human\nexperts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical\nrubric.\n  Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored\npeer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16;\np=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th\n(mean 6.97). Conversely, the AI judge produced a complete inversion, scoring AI\nplans significantly higher than human plans (mean 7.75 vs. 6.79; p=0.0313). It\nranked o3 1st (mean 8.20) and GPT-4o 2nd, placing all human experts lower.\n  Conclusions: The perceived quality of a clinical plan is fundamentally\ndependent on the evaluator's nature. An advanced reasoning AI, ranked poorly by\nhuman experts, was judged as superior by a sophisticated AI, revealing a deep\ngap between experience-based clinical heuristics and data-driven algorithmic\nlogic.
