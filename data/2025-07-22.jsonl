With the developments of\nLLMs, building LLM-based agents for automatic thread investigation is a\npromising direction. To assist the development and evaluation of LLM agents, we\nconstruct a dataset from a controlled Azure tenant that covers 8 simulated\nreal-world multi-step attacks, 57 log tables from Microsoft Sentinel and\nrelated services, and 589 automatically generated questions. We leverage\nsecurity logs extracted with expert-crafted detection logic to build threat\ninvestigation graphs, and then generate questions with LLMs using paired nodes\non the graph, taking the start node as background context and the end node as\nanswer. Anchoring each question to these explicit nodes and edges not only\nprovides automatic, explainable ground truth answers but also makes the\npipeline reusable and readily extensible to new logs.

Our analysis focuses on two key investor\nactions: the initial allocation decision at time t=0, and the optimal timing of\nexit. First, we derive an optimal allocation strategy that enables the investor\nto distribute risk across the LSP, AMM, and direct holding. Our results also\noffer insights for LSP and AMM designers, identifying the necessary and\nsufficient conditions under which the investor is incentivized to stake through\nan LSP, and further, to provide liquidity in addition to staking. These\nconditions include a lower bound on the transaction fee, for which we propose a\nfee mechanism that attains the bound. Second, given a fixed protocol design, we\nmodel the optimal exit timing of an individual investor using Laplace\ntransforms and free-boundary techniques. We analyze scenarios with and without\ntransaction fees. In the absence of fees, we decompose the investor's payoff\ninto impermanent loss and opportunity cost, and provide theoretical results\ncharacterizing the investor's payoff and the optimal exit threshold. With\ntransaction fees, we conduct numerical analyses to examine how fee accumulation\ninfluences exit strategies. Our results reveal that in both settings, a\nstop-loss strategy often maximizes the investor's expected payoff, driven by\nopportunity gains and the accumulation of fees where fees are present.

This paper proposes a theoretical framework, called the Free\nWill Equation, that draws analogies from quantum field theory to endow AGI\nagents with a form of adaptive, controlled stochasticity in their\ndecision-making process. The core idea is to treat an AI agent's cognitive\nstate as a superposition of potential actions or thoughts, which collapses\nprobabilistically into a concrete action when a decision is made - much like a\nquantum wavefunction collapsing upon measurement. By incorporating mechanisms\nanalogous to quantum fields, along with intrinsic motivation terms, we aim to\nimprove an agent's ability to explore novel strategies and adapt to unforeseen\nchanges.

However, adopting AI models in risk-sensitive\ndomains often requires error rates near 0%. To address this gap, we propose\ncollaboration between a reasoning model and a human expert who resolves queries\nthe model cannot confidently answer. We find that quantifying the uncertainty\nof a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an\neffective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3\n235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring\n7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them\nchallenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this\nchallenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning\nmodel. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system \"Fail Fast, or Ask\",\nsince the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert\ndirectly (\"failing fast\"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher\nlatency. We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and\nabout 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the\naccuracy-rejection curve. However, we observe that latency savings are lower\nthan expected because of \"latency drag\", the phenomenon that processing easier\nqueries with a non-reasoning model pushes the reasoning model's latency\ndistribution towards longer latencies. Broadly, our results suggest that the\ndeficiencies of state-of-the-art reasoning models -- nontrivial error rates and\nhigh latency -- can be substantially mitigated through black-box systems\nengineering, without requiring access to LLM internals."}

Among these\nattacks, the model completion (MC) attack is currently the most powerful one.\nExisting defense methods against it either sacrifice model accuracy or incur\nimpractical computational overhead. In this paper, we propose VMask, a novel\nlabel privacy protection framework designed to defend against MC attack from\nthe perspective of layer masking. Our key insight is to disrupt the strong\ncorrelation between input data and intermediate outputs by applying the secret\nsharing (SS) technique to mask layer parameters in the attacker's model. We\ndevise a strategy for selecting critical layers to mask, reducing the overhead\nthat would arise from naively applying SS to the entire model. Moreover, VMask\nis the first framework to offer a tunable privacy budget to defenders, allowing\nfor flexible control over the levels of label privacy according to actual\nrequirements. We built a VFL system, implemented VMask on it, and extensively\nevaluated it using five model architectures and 13 datasets with different\nmodalities, comparing it to 12 other defense methods. The results demonstrate\nthat VMask achieves the best privacy-utility trade-off, successfully thwarting\nthe MC attack (reducing the label inference accuracy to a random guessing\nlevel) while preserving model performance (e.g., in Transformer-based model,\nthe averaged drop of VFL model accuracy is only 0.09%).

TEEs can achieve this through\nremote attestation, where a prover presents evidence of its trustworthiness to\na verifier, which then decides whether or not to trust the prover. However, a\nnaive peer-to-peer attestation approach, where every TEE directly attests every\nother TEE, results in quadratic communication overhead.

The achievable\nrate is simplified using the Arimoto-Blahut algorithm, and the problem is\nbroken into quadratic programs with quadratic constraints (QPQC) sub-problems\nusing an alternating optimization approach. To improve efficiency, we develop a\nmodel-based neural network optimization that utilizes the one-hot encoding for\nthe angles of incidence and reflection. We address practical RIS limitations by\nusing a greedy search algorithm to solve the optimization problem for discrete\nphase shifts. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods\neffectively shape the multi-beam radiation pattern towards desired directions\nwhile satisfying reradiation mask constraints. The neural network design\nreduces the execution time, and the discrete phase shift scheme performs well\nwith a small reduction of the beamforming gain by using only four phase shift\nlevels."}

To meet growing data demands, some LAWN deployments incorporate\nfree-space optical (FSO) links, which offer exceptional bandwidth and beam\ndirectivity. However, without strong security measures in place, both\nconventional radio frequency channels and FSO beams remain vulnerable to\ninterception and spoofing and FSO in particular can suffer from turbulence,\nmisalignment, and weather-related attenuation. To address these challenges in\nthe quantum era, a quantum-secure architecture called Quantum Skyshield is\nproposed to enable reliable communication between the base transceiver station\n(BTS) and LAWN. The proposed design integrates BB84 quantum key distribution\n(QKD) with post-quantum authentication mechanisms. Simulation results confirm\nthe reliable generation of a 128-bit symmetric key when the quantum bit error\nrate (QBER) remains below the threshold of 11%. Authentication is enforced\nusing Lamport one-time signatures and hash-based message authentication codes\n(HMAC) to ensure message integrity. A Grover-inspired threat detection\nmechanism identifies anomalies with up to 89% probability in a single\niteration, enabling real-time trust evaluation. Lastly, future research\nchallenges have also been identified and discussed to guide further development\nin this area."}

Existing methods such as direct allocation, pseudo-inverse,\ncascaded generalized inverse, and exact redistributed pseudo-inverse either\ncannot handle rate constraints in continuous time or require discretization\napproaches that compromise performance. Current QP methods that incorporate\nrate constraints rely on slack variables to ensure feasibility, which prevents\nfull utilization of the attainable moment set and degrades allocation\nperformance. The proposed methodology addresses this limitation by calculating\nthe attainable moment set from both position and rate constraints through\nconvex hull operations, then ensuring feasibility by scaling unattainable\ncommanded moments to the boundary of the attainable moment set while preserving\ntheir direction. This approach guarantees the feasibility of the optimization\nproblem without slack variables.

The choice of fuzzing is further\ncomplicated when only a binary library is available, such as the case of\nclosed-source and proprietary software. In response, we introduce LibLMFuzz, a\nframework that reduces costs associated with fuzzing closed-source libraries by\npairing an agentic Large Language Model (LLM) with a lightweight tool-chain\n(disassembler/compiler/fuzzer) to autonomously analyze stripped binaries, plan\nfuzz strategies, generate drivers, and iteratively self-repair build or runtime\nerrors.

In this work, we introduce two new\nproblems: the Matrix Subcode Equivalence Problem and the Matrix Code Permuted\nKernel Problem, to which we apply the MPCitH paradigm to build a signature\nscheme. These new problems, closely related to the Matrix Code Equivalence\nproblem, ask to find an isometry given a code $C$ and a subcode $D$.\nFurthermore, we prove that the Matrix Subcode Equivalence problem reduces to\nthe Hamming Subcode Equivalence problem, which is known to be NP-Complete, thus\nintroducing the matrix code version of the Permuted Kernel Problem.

To\naddress this, we introduce the Causal Action Influence Score (CAIS), a novel\nintrinsic reward rooted in causal inference. CAIS quantifies an action's\ninfluence by measuring the 1-Wasserstein distance between the learned\ndistribution of sensory outcomes conditional on that action, $p(h|a)$, and the\nbaseline outcome distribution, $p(h)$. This divergence provides a robust reward\nthat isolates the agent's causal impact from confounding environmental noise.\nWe test our approach in a simulated infant-mobile environment where\ncorrelation-based perceptual rewards fail completely when the mobile is\nsubjected to external forces. In stark contrast, CAIS enables the agent to\nfilter this noise, identify its influence, and learn the correct policy.\nFurthermore, the high-quality predictive model learned for CAIS allows our\nagent, when augmented with a surprise signal, to successfully reproduce the\n\"extinction burst\" phenomenon.

Batching allows managers to trade off cost and\nprocessing effort against waiting time. Larger and less frequent batches may\nlower costs by reducing processing effort and amortizing fixed costs, but they\ncreate longer waiting times. In contrast, smaller and more frequent batches\nreduce waiting times but increase fixed costs and processing effort. A batching\npolicy defines how activity instances are grouped into batches and when each\nbatch is activated. This paper addresses the problem of discovering batching\npolicies that strike optimal trade-offs between waiting time, processing\neffort, and cost. The paper proposes a Pareto optimization approach that starts\nfrom a given set (possibly empty) of activity batching policies and generates\nalternative policies for each batched activity via intervention heuristics.\nEach heuristic identifies an opportunity to improve an activity's batching\npolicy with respect to a metric (waiting time, processing time, cost, or\nresource utilization) and an associated adjustment to the activity's batching\npolicy (the intervention). The impact of each intervention is evaluated via\nsimulation. The intervention heuristics are embedded in an optimization\nmeta-heuristic that triggers interventions to iteratively update the Pareto\nfront of the interventions identified so far. The paper considers three\nmeta-heuristics: hill-climbing, simulated annealing, and reinforcement\nlearning.

This means that actors can make independent decisions based\non their own background, goals, and emotional state. In addition to\nconversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of\nscene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon.\nThe change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know\nand care about, which in turn influences their next action. To evaluate the\nquality of drama performance, we designed an evaluation method to assess three\nprimary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and\ninteraction experience.

To assist the development and evaluation of LLM agents, we\nconstruct a dataset from a controlled Azure tenant that covers 8 simulated\nreal-world multi-step attacks, 57 log tables from Microsoft Sentinel and\nrelated services, and 589 automatically generated questions. We leverage\nsecurity logs extracted with expert-crafted detection logic to build threat\ninvestigation graphs, and then generate questions with LLMs using paired nodes\non the graph, taking the start node as background context and the end node as\nanswer. Anchoring each question to these explicit nodes and edges not only\nprovides automatic, explainable ground truth answers but also makes the\npipeline reusable and readily extensible to new logs. This also enables the\nautomatic generation of procedural tasks with verifiable rewards, which can be\nnaturally extended to training agents via reinforcement learning. Our\ncomprehensive experiments with different models confirm the difficulty of the\ntask: with the base setting, the average reward across all evaluated models is\n0.249, and the best achieved is 0.368, leaving substantial headroom for future\nresearch. Code and data are coming soon!"}

However, successful attacks on these systems can lead to\nsevere consequences. Recent research on threats targeting ViT models primarily\nfocuses on generating the smallest adversarial perturbations that can deceive\nthe models with high confidence, without considering their impact on model\ninterpretations. Nevertheless, the use of interpretation models can effectively\nassist in detecting adversarial examples. This study investigates the\nvulnerability of transformer models to adversarial attacks, even when combined\nwith interpretation models. We propose an attack called \"AdViT\" that generates\nadversarial examples capable of misleading both a given transformer model and\nits coupled interpretation model. Through extensive experiments on various\ntransformer models and two transformer-based interpreters, we demonstrate that\nAdViT achieves a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box\nscenarios. In white-box scenarios, it reaches up to 98% misclassification\nconfidence, while in black-box scenarios, it reaches up to 76%\nmisclassification confidence.

Existing methods rely on\nunrealistic assumptions (e.g., accessing VFL-model's outputs) and ignore\nanomaly detectors deployed in real-world systems. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce VTarbel, a two-stage, minimal-knowledge attack framework explicitly\ndesigned to evade detector-enhanced VFL inference. During the preparation\nstage, the attacker selects a minimal set of high-expressiveness samples (via\nmaximum mean discrepancy), submits them through VFL protocol to collect\npredicted labels, and uses these pseudo-labels to train estimated detector and\nsurrogate model on local features.

In this paper, we propose VMask, a novel\nlabel privacy protection framework designed to defend against MC attack from\nthe perspective of layer masking. Our key insight is to disrupt the strong\ncorrelation between input data and intermediate outputs by applying the secret\nsharing (SS) technique to mask layer parameters in the attacker's model. We\ndevise a strategy for selecting critical layers to mask, reducing the overhead\nthat would arise from naively applying SS to the entire model. Moreover, VMask\nis the first framework to offer a tunable privacy budget to defenders, allowing\nfor flexible control over the levels of label privacy according to actual\nrequirements. We built a VFL system, implemented VMask on it, and extensively\nevaluated it using five model architectures and 13 datasets with different\nmodalities, comparing it to 12 other defense methods.
