The change in pH is induced either by the addition of alkaline\nsolution such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or by the addition of a carbon dioxide\ngas (CO$_2$) to the given ionic solution. Under this setup we propose a system\nof degenerate stochastic partial differential equations that is able to explain\nthe dynamical behavior of the key components of precipitation process. In\nparticular, we propose a semi-linear advection equation for the dynamics of\nparticle size distribution (PSD) of the precipitated particles. This is in turn\ncoupled with a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that is able\nto explain the chemical kinetics between calcium ions (Ca$^{+2}$), calcium\ncarbonate (CaCO$_3$) in aqueous state and pH of the solution. The resulting\ncoupled system is first mathematically studied, in particular conditions for\nthe existence of a mild-solution is established and also the long time behavior\nof the system is established. Following this we consider the validation of the\nmodel for which we consider experimentally obtained lab-scale data. Using this\ndata we propose three methods to fit the model with the data which then also\nvalidates the suitability of the proposed model. The three methods include\nmanual intuitive tuning, classical forward backward SDE (FBSDE) method and\nfinally a DNN based method. The FBSDE method is based on the stochastic optimal\ncontrol formulation for which we provide the necessary and sufficient condition\nfor the existence of an optimal solution. Lastly, we compare the three methods\nand show that DNN method is the best in terms of lowest error and as the most\neconomical in terms of the compute resources necessary during online use."}

In this paper, we demonstrate that deliberately removing\nthis redundancy in the reasoning process significantly improves performance\nthrough clear thinking, i.e., removing distraction. Specifically, we\nsystematically identify reasoning redundancy by measuring token-level attention\nscores to a special end-of-thinking token, which is appended to an explicit\ninstruction inserted to conclude each intermediate reasoning step. Furthermore,\nwe propose structure-aware pruning that prioritizes removing tokens in\nlow-contributing reasoning chunks over individual tokens.

Properties of pedigrees,\npedigree polytopes, adjacency structure of the graph of the pedigree polytope\nand their implication on the adjacency structure of the Symmetric Travelling\nSalesman problem (STSP) polytope have been studied earlier in the literature by\nthe author.\n  The question: Given $X$, does it belong to the pedigree polytope for $n$? is\ncalled the membership problem. This article provides proof that the membership\nproblem for pedigree polytopes can be solved efficiently. Due to the pedigree's\nstem property, we can check the membership problem sequentially for $ k \\in [4,\nn]$.

In 1999, Reed confirmed the conjecture when $\\Delta\\geq\n10^{14}$.\n  We propose different generalisations of this conjecture for digraphs, and\nprove the analogue of Reed's result for each of them. The chromatic number and\nclique number are replaced respectively by the dichromatic number and the\nbiclique number of digraphs. If $D$ is a digraph such that\n$\\min(\\tilde{\\Delta}(D),\\Delta^+(D)) = \\Delta \\geq 9$, we conjecture that $D$\nhas dichromatic number at most $\\Delta-1$, unless either (i) $D$ contains a\nbiclique of size $\\Delta$, or (ii) $D$ contains a biclique $K$ of size\n$\\Delta-2$, a directed $3$-cycle $\\vec{C_3}$ disjoint from $K$, and all\npossible arcs in both directions between $\\vec{C_3}$ and $K$.

We prove it when $\\Delta$ is\nlarge enough, thereby generalising the result of Reed.\n  We finally give a sufficient condition for a digraph $D$ to have dichromatic\nnumber at most $\\Delta_{\\min}(D)-1$, assuming that $\\Delta_{\\min}(D)$ is large\nenough. In particular, this holds when the underlying graph of $D$ has no\nclique of size $\\Delta_{\\min}(D)$, thus yielding a third independent\ngeneralisation of Reed's result. We further give a hardness result witnessing\nthat our sufficient condition is best possible.\n  To obtain these new upper bounds on the dichromatic number, we prove a dense\ndecomposition lemma for digraphs having large maximum degree, which generalises\nto the directed setting the so-called dense decomposition of graphs due to\nMolloy and Reed.

We formulate a joint\noptimization of inventory control and communication strategies, aiming to\nbalance the trade-off between communication overhead and operational\nperformance (service levels, holding, and stockout costs). We adopt a common\ninformation framework and derive a centralized Partially Observable Markov\nDecision Process (POMDP) model for a supply chain coordinator. Solving this\ncoordinator's POMDP via dynamic programming characterizes the structure of\noptimal policies, determining when retailers should communicate and how they\nshould adjust orders based on available information.

To this end, this paper\nproposes a novel secure framework named CovertAuth, designed to enhance the\nsecurity of the BA phase against such attacks. In particular, to combat\neavesdropping attacks, the closed-form expressions of successful BA probability\nand covert transmission rate are first derived. Then, a covert communication\nproblem aimed at jointly optimizing beam training budget and transmission power\nis formulated to maximize covert communication rate, subject to the covertness\nrequirement. An alternating optimization algorithm combined with successive\nconvex approximation is employed to iteratively achieve optimal results. To\ncombat impersonation attacks, the mutual coupling effect of antenna array\nimpairments is explored as a device feature to design a weighted-sum energy\ndetector based physical layer authentication scheme. Moreover, theoretical\nmodels for authentication metrics like detection and false alarm probabilities\nare also provided to conduct performance analysis.

The advantage of these separations\nis that no direction for departure from any hypothesised model is needed,\navoiding issues that would otherwise arise from using the same data for\nreduction and for model assessment.

These are credentials\nthat are managed throughout the key lifecycle by an authenticator on behalf of\nthe user and offer strong security guarantees.\n  Passwords remain the dominant mode of SSH authentication, despite their well\nknown flaws such as phishing and reuse. SSH's custom key-based authentication\nprotocol can alleviate these issues but remains vulnerable to key theft.\nAdditionally, it has poor usability, with even knowledgeable users leaking key\nmaterial and failing to verify fingerprints. Hence, effective key management\nremains a critical open area in SSH security. In contrast, WebAuthn is a modern\nauthentication standard designed to replace passwords, managing keys on behalf\nof the user. As a web API, this standard cannot integrate with SSH directly.\n  We propose a framework to integrate WebAuthn with SSH servers, by using UNIX\npluggable authentication modules (PAM). Our approach is backwards-compatible,\nsupports stock SSH servers and requires no new software client-side. It offers\nprotection for cryptographic material at rest, resistance to key leaks,\nphishing protection, privacy protection and attestation capability. None of\nthese properties are offered by passwords nor traditional SSH keys. We validate\nthese advantages with a structured, conceptual security analysis.\n  We develop a prototype implementation and conduct a user study to quantify\nthe security advantages of our proposal, testing our prototype with 40 SSH\nusers. The study confirms the security problems of SSH-keys, including 20% of\nthe cohort leaking their private keys. Our SSH-passkeys effectively address\nthese problems: we find a 90% reduction in critical security errors, while\nreducing authentication time by 4x on average."}

Current\nmethods remain reactive, employing stimulus-response mechanisms that fail when\nfacing novel scenarios. We argue for a transformative paradigm shift from\nreactive to proactive multi-agent intelligence through generative AI-based\nreinforcement learning. This position advocates reconceptualizing agents not as\nisolated policy optimizers, but as sophisticated generative models capable of\nsynthesizing complex multi-agent dynamics and making anticipatory decisions\nbased on predictive understanding of future interactions. Rather than\nresponding to immediate observations, generative-RL agents can model\nenvironment evolution, predict other agents' behaviors, generate coordinated\naction sequences, and engage in strategic reasoning accounting for long-term\ndynamics. This approach leverages pattern recognition and generation\ncapabilities of generative AI to enable proactive decision-making, seamless\ncoordination through enhanced communication, and dynamic adaptation to evolving\nscenarios. We envision this paradigm shift will unlock unprecedented\npossibilities for distributed intelligence, moving beyond individual\noptimization toward emergent collective behaviors representing genuine\ncollaborative intelligence. The implications extend across autonomous systems,\nrobotics, and human-AI collaboration, promising solutions to coordination\nchallenges intractable under traditional reactive frameworks."}

Among the various design considerations, constellation\nconfiguration -- how satellites are placed and distributed in space relative to\neach other -- predominantly determines the resulting coverage. In constellation\nconfiguration design, coverage can be considered either as an objective or a\nconstraint, driven by mission objectives.

Herein,\nwe present the bilevel optimization formulation SimulKnockReactor, which\nconnects bioreactor design with microbial strain design, an extension of our\nprevious formulation, SimulKnock (Ziegler et al., 2024, AIChE J.). At the upper\n(bioreactor) level, we minimize investment and operation costs for agitation,\naeration, and pH control by determining the size and operating conditions of a\ncontinuous stirred-tank reactor - without selecting specific devices like the\nstirrer type. The lower (cellular) level is based on flux balance analysis and\nimplements optimal reaction knockouts predicted by the upper level. Our results\nwith a core and a genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli show that\nthe substrate is the largest cost factor. Our simultaneous approach outperforms\na sequential approach using OptKnock. Namely, the knockouts proposed by\nOptKnock cannot guarantee the required production capacity in all cases\nconsidered. In the case that both approaches deliver feasible results, the\ntotal annual costs are the same or lower with SimulKnockReactor, highlighting\nthe advantage of combining cellular and bioreactor levels. This work is a\nfurther step towards a fully integrated bioprocess design."}

Our\nexperiments prove that directly combining ParPS with the sequential update\nscheme leads to the policy updating baseline drift problem, thereby failing to\nachieve improvement. To solve the conflict between monotonic improvement and\nParPS, we propose the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG)\nalgorithm.

Departing from\nclassical Stackelberg assumptions of complete information and rational agents,\nour formulation allows each agent to reason through structured prompts,\ngenerate probabilistic behaviors via LLMs, and adapt their strategies through\ninternal cognition and belief updates. We define two equilibrium concepts:\nreasoning and behavioral equilibrium, which aligns an agent's internal\nprompt-based reasoning with observable behavior, and conjectural reasoning\nequilibrium, which accounts for epistemic uncertainty through parameterized\nmodels over an opponent's response. These layered constructs capture bounded\nrationality, asymmetric information, and meta-cognitive adaptation.

In this paper, we\nintroduce Logic-Layer Prompt Control Injection (LPCI), a novel attack category\nin which encoded, delayed, and conditionally triggered payloads are embedded in\nmemory, vector stores, or tool outputs. These payloads can bypass conventional\ninput filters and trigger unauthorised behaviour across sessions."}
