Abstract: Moment matching is an easy-to-implement and usually effective method to
reduce variance of Monte Carlo simulation estimates. On the other hand, there
is no guarantee that moment matching will always reduce simulation variance for
general integration problems at least asymptotically, i.e. when the number of
samples is large. We study the characterization of conditions on a given
underlying distribution $X$ under which asymptotic variance reduction is
guaranteed for a general integration problem $\mathbb{E}[f(X)]$ when moment
matching techniques are applied. We show that a sufficient and necessary
condition for such asymptotic variance reduction property is $X$ being a normal
distribution. Moreover, when $X$ is a normal distribution, formulae for
efficient estimation of simulation variance for (first and second order) moment
matching Monte Carlo are obtained. These formulae allow estimations of
simulation variance as by-products of the simulation process, in a way similar
to variance estimations for plain Monte Carlo. Moreover, we propose non-linear
moment matching schemes for any given continuous distribution such that
asymptotic variance reduction is guaranteed.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: The Koml\'os$\unicode{x2013}$Major$\unicode{x2013}$Tusn\'ady (KMT) inequality
for partial sums is one of the most celebrated results in probability theory.
Yet its practical application is hindered by its dependence on unknown
constants. This paper addresses this limitation for bounded i.i.d. random
variables. At the cost of an additional logarithmic factor, we propose a
computable version of the KMT inequality that depends only on the variables'
range and standard deviation. We also derive an empirical version of the
inequality that achieves nominal coverage even when the standard deviation is
unknown. We then demonstrate the practicality of our bounds through
applications to online change point detection and first hitting time
probabilities.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: We study rates of convergence for estimation of the Gromov-Wasserstein
distance. For two marginals supported on compact subsets of $\R^{d_x}$ and
$\R^{d_y}$, respectively, with $\min \{ d_x,d_y \} > 4$, prior work established
the rate $n^{-\frac{2}{\min\{d_x,d_y\}}}$ for the plug-in empirical estimator
based on $n$ i.i.d. samples. We extend this fundamental result to marginals
with unbounded supports, assuming only finite polynomial moments. Our proof
techniques for the upper bounds can be adapted to obtain sample complexity
results for penalized Wasserstein alignment that encompasses the
Gromov-Wasserstein distance and Wasserstein Procrustes in unbounded settings.
Furthermore, we establish matching minimax lower bounds (up to logarithmic
factors) for estimating the Gromov-Wasserstein distance.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: We study parameter estimation for interacting particle systems (IPSs)
consisting of $N$ weakly interacting multivariate hypoelliptic SDEs. We propose
a locally Gaussian approximation of the transition dynamics, carefully designed
to address the degenerate structure of the noise (diffusion matrix), thus
leading to the formation of a well-defined full likelihood. Our approach
permits carrying out statistical inference for a wide class of hypoelliptic
IPSs that are not covered by recent works as the latter rely on the
Euler-Maruyama scheme. We analyze a contrast estimator based on the developed
likelihood with $n$ high-frequency particle observations over a fixed period
$[0,T]$ and show its asymptotic normality as $n, N \to \infty$ with a
requirement that the step-size $\Delta_n = T/n$ is such that
$N\Delta_n\rightarrow 0$, assuming that all particle coordinates (e.g.~position
and velocity) are observed. In practical situations where only partial
observations (e.g. particle positions but not velocities) are available, the
proposed locally Gaussian approximation offers greater flexibility for
inference, when combined with established Bayesian techniques. In particular,
unlike the Euler-Maruyama-based approaches, we do not have to impose
restrictive structures on the hypoelliptic IPSs. We present numerical
experiments that illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, both with
complete and partial particle observations.

Abstract: In this paper, we study a model of network formation in large populations.
Each agent can choose the strength of interaction (i.e. connection) with other
agents to find a Nash equilibrium. Different from the recently-developed theory
of graphon games, here each agent's control depends not only on her own index
but also on the index of other agents. After defining the general model of the
game, we focus on a special case with piecewise constant graphs and we provide
optimality conditions through a system of forward-backward stochastic
differential equations. Furthermore, we show the uniqueness and existence
results. Finally, we provide numerical experiments to discuss the effects of
different model settings.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Simulation optimization is often hindered by the high cost of running
simulations. Multi-fidelity methods offer a promising solution by incorporating
cheaper, lower-fidelity simulations to reduce computational time. However, the
bias in low-fidelity models can mislead the search, potentially steering
solutions away from the high-fidelity optimum. To overcome this, we propose
ASTRO-MFDF, an adaptive sampling trust-region method for multi-fidelity
simulation optimization. ASTRO-MFDF features two key strategies: (i) it
adaptively determines the sample size and selects appropriate sampling
strategies to reduce computational cost; and (ii) it selectively uses
low-fidelity information only when a high correlation with the high-fidelity is
anticipated, reducing the risk of bias. We validate the performance and
computational efficiency of ASTRO-MFDF through numerical experiments using the
SimOpt library.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: In this paper we study the relationship between the set of all non-negative
multivariate homogeneous polynomials and those, which we call hyperwrons, whose
non-negativity can be deduced from an identity involving the Wronskians of
hyperbolic polynomials. We give a sufficient condition on positive integers $m$
and $2y$ such that there are non-negative polynomials of degree $2y$ in $m$
variables that are not hyperwrons. Furthermore, we give an explicit example of
a non-negative quartic form that is not a sum of hyperwrons. We partially
extend our results to hyperzouts, which are polynomials whose non-negativity
can be deduced from an identity involving the B\'ezoutians of hyperbolic
polynomials.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: This paper describes the implementation of a new interior point solver for
linear programming for the open-source optimization library HiGHS. The solver
uses a direct factorisation to solve the Newton systems, choosing the best
approach between the normal equations and augmented system. Details of the
multifrontal factorisation routine are given, with attention to the features
that allow to achieve high performance, like storage formats, use of efficient
dense linear algebra subroutines and parallelism. The paper also describes the
use of pivoting and regularisation strategies to ensure that a stable
factorisation is obtained, despite the ill-conditioning of the matrices.
Results on three different collections of problems are presented which
highlight the improved performance of the solver compared to the existing HiGHS
interior point method.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: This paper studies bandit convex optimization in non-stationary environments
with two-point feedback, using dynamic regret as the performance measure. We
propose an algorithm based on bandit mirror descent that extends naturally to
non-Euclidean settings. Let $T$ be the total number of iterations and
$\mathcal{P}_{T,p}$ the path variation with respect to the $\ell_p$-norm. In
Euclidean space, our algorithm matches the optimal regret bound
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{dT(1+\mathcal{P}_{T,2})})$, improving upon Zhao et al.
(2021) by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d})$. Beyond Euclidean settings, our
algorithm achieves an upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d\log(d) T(1 +
\mathcal{P}_{T,1})})$ on the simplex, which is optimal up to a $\log(d)$
factor. For the cross-polytope, the bound reduces to
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d\log(d)T(1+\mathcal{P}_{T,p})})$ for some $p = 1 +
1/\log(d)$.

Abstract: In this paper we prove a correspondence between a canonical degree six

ternary quadratic forms $(f_A, f_B)$. In the process we obtain a canonical way
to diagonalize a pair of $n$-ary quadratic forms over any field $K$ of
characteristic zero. As a corollary, we give a precise criterion to decide
whether a pair of $n$-ary quadratic forms over $\mathbb{Q}$ is diagonalizable
over $\mathbb{Q}$.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: We define $\overline{R_l^*}(n)$ as the number of overpartitions of $n$ in
which non-overlined parts are not divisible by $l$. In a recent work, Nath,
Saikia, and the second author established several families of congruences for
$\overline{R_l^*}(n)$, with particular focus on the cases $l=6$ and $l=8$. In
the concluding remarks of their paper, they conjectured that
$\overline{R_6^*}(n)$ satisfies an infinite family of congruences modulo $128$.
In this paper, we confirm their conjectures using elementary methods.
Additionally, we provide elementary proofs of two congruences for
$\overline{R_6^*}(n)$ previously proven via the machinery of modular forms by
Alanazi, Munagi, and Saikia.

this paper, we extend the list of such congruences in two directions. First, we
prove some new individual congruences for $\overline{spt2}(n)$. Then, we
provide a number of infinite families of Ramanujan-like congruences satisfied
by $\overline{spt2}(n)$.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: We investigate races among prime ideals in number fields when there are two
or more competing conjugacy classes. In their work [4], Fiorilli and Jouve
studied two-way races in number fields and showed that-unlike the classical
setting of primes in arithmetic progressions-these biases can approach the
extreme values of 0 and 1. They also identified when these biases tend toward
one-half (as the degree of the extension grows), which we call ''moderate
biases'' because that behavior mirrors the classical case. In this paper, we
extend their analysis to races with r competing conjugacy classes (rway races)
and precisely study the cases where these biases are moderate (meaning they
tend to 1/r! as the discriminant of the extension grows). Our first main result
is an explicit formula for the bias in any r-way race (for all r $\ge$ 2),
generalizing the two-way formula of Fiorilli and Jouve [4] and Lamzouri's r-way
expression in the classical case of residue classes modulo q [12], under the
same hypotheses. Using this formula, we give a criterion characterizing
completely, in the abelian case, r-moderate races. Surprisingly, once r $\ge$ 3
this criterion is independent of r, making the two-way race exceptional. We
also construct families of number fields exhibiting such moderacy, we prove
density results for the values of logarithmic densities and exhibit different
behaviors of those densities between the cases r = 3 and r $\ge$ 4. and showed
that its magnitude governs the bias: 2 ) converges to the extreme values 1 or
0. $\bullet$ Moderate bias. Under additional hypotheses (automatically
satisfied in the abelian case), if L/K (C 1 , C 2 ) $\rightarrow$ 1/2,
mirroring the classical prime-ideal race studied by Rubinstein-Sarnak and
Fiorilli-Martin. Applying this criterion to several explicit families such that
the degree grows to $\infty$, Fiorilli and Jouve produced examples of both
moderate and extreme biases along families of number fields. In the same
spirit, Bailleul [1] investigated dihedral and quaternion extensions,
uncovering further families in which the densities not only approach the value
1/2 but can again be made to lie arbitrarily near the extremes, while also
highlighting the influence of central zeros of Artin L-functions on the
behavior of those densities.

Abstract: In a recent paper, Enayat and Le lyk [2024] show that second order arithmetic
and countable set theory are not definitionally equivalent. It is well known
that these theories are biinterpretable. Thus, we have a pair of natural
theories that llustrate a meaningful difference between definitional
equivalence and bi-interpretability. This is particularly interesting given
that Visser and Friedman [2014] have shown that a wide class of natural
foundational theories in mathematics are such that if they are
bi-interpretable, then they are also definitionally equivalent. The proof
offered by Enayat and Le lyk makes use of an inaccessible cardinal. In this
short note, we show that the failure of bi-interpretability can be established
in Peano Arithmetic merely supposing that one of our target theories are
consistent.

Abstract: We solve a long-standing open problem of Shelah regarding the

$\aleph_\gamma$, a regular cardinal $\mu\in
(\mathrm{cf}(\gamma),\aleph_\gamma)$ and assuming appropriate large cardinal
hypotheses, we construct a model of $\mathsf{ZFC}$ in which $\aleph_{\gamma+1}
\cap \mathrm{cof}(\mu) \notin I[\aleph_{\gamma+1}]$. This provides a definitive
answer to a question of Shelah from the 80's. In addition, assuming large
cardinals, we construct a model of $\mathsf{ZFC}$ in which the approachability
property fails, simultaneously, at every singular cardinal. This is a major
milestone in the solution of a question of Foreman and Magidor from the 80's.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: The Beck-Fiala Conjecture [Discrete Appl. Math, 1981] asserts that any set
system of $n$ elements with degree $k$ has combinatorial discrepancy
$O(\sqrt{k})$. A substantial generalization is the Koml\'os Conjecture, which
states that any $m \times n$ matrix with unit length columns has discrepancy
$O(1)$.
  In this work, we resolve the Beck-Fiala Conjecture for $k \geq \log^2 n$. We
also give an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k} + \sqrt{\log n})$ bound for $k \leq \log^2
n$, where $\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides $\mathsf{poly}(\log \log n)$ factors.
These bounds improve upon the $O(\sqrt{k \log n})$ bound due to Banaszczyk
[Random Struct. Algor., 1998].
  For the Komlos problem, we give an $\widetilde{O}(\log^{1/4} n)$ bound,
improving upon the previous $O(\sqrt{\log n})$ bound [Random Struct. Algor.,
1998]. All of our results also admit efficient polynomial-time algorithms.
  To obtain these results, we consider a new notion of affine
spectral-independence in designing random walks. In particular, our algorithms
obtain the desired colorings via a discrete Brownian motion, guided by a
semidefinite program (SDP). Besides standard constraints used in prior works,
we add some extra affine spectral-independence constraints, which effectively
decouple the evolution of discrepancy across different rows, and allow us to
better control how many rows accumulate large discrepancy at any point during
the process. This technique of ``decoupling via affine spectral-independence''
is quite general and may be of independent interest.

Abstract: The only known example of an almost perfect nonlinear (APN) permutation in
even dimension was obtained by applying CCZ-equivalence to a specific quadratic
APN function. Motivated by this result, there have been numerous recent
attempts to construct new quadratic APN functions. Currently, 32,892 quadratic
APN functions in dimension 8 are known and two recent conjectures address their
possible total number. The first, proposed by Y. Yu and L. Perrin (Cryptogr.
Commun. 14(6): 1359-1369, 2022), suggests that there are more than 50,000 such
functions. The second, by A. Polujan and A. Pott (Proc. 7th Int. Workshop on
Boolean Functions and Their Applications, 2022), argues that their number
exceeds that of inequivalent quadratic (8,4)-bent functions, which is 92,515.
We computationally construct 3,775,599 inequivalent quadratic APN functions in
dimension 8 and estimate the total number to be about 6 million.

Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph. The {\em spectral radius} of $G$ is the largest
eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. For a non-complete bipartite graph $G$ with
parts $X$ and $Y$, the {\em bipartite toughness} of $G$ is defined as
$t^{B}(G)=\min\left\{\frac{|S|}{c(G-S)}\right\}$, where the minimum is taken
over all proper subsets $S\subset X$ (or $S\subset Y$) such that $c(G-S)>1$. In
this paper, we give a sharp spectral radius condition for balanced bipartite
graphs $G$ with $t^{B}(G)\geq1$ to guarantee that $G$ contains Hamilton cycles.
This solves a problem proposed in \cite{CFL}.

Abstract: For graphs $H$, we study the extremal function $M_H(n)$ which is the maximum
running time (until stabilisation) of an $H$-bootstrap percolation process on
$n$ vertices. Building on previous work in the clique case $H=K_k$, we develop
a general framework of chain constructions. We demonstrate the flexibility of
this framework by applying several variations of the method to give lower
bounds on $M_H(n)$ for a wide variety of different graphs $H$ including dense
graphs, random graphs and complete bipartite graphs. In particular, we focus on
the question of whether $M_H(n)$ is (almost) quadratic or not and our lower
bounds develop connections with additive combinatorics, utilising constructions
of sets free of solutions to certain linear equations. Finally, our lower
bounds are complemented by upper bounds which connect $M_H(n)$ to other
problems in extremal graph theory such as the Ruzsa-Szemer\'edi (6,3)-Theorem.

Abstract: In [1], a new quasi-Hermitian variety $\mathcal{H}_\varepsilon^r$ in
$\mathrm{PG}(r, q^2)$, with $q = 2^e$ and $e \geq 3$ an odd integer, was
constructed. The variety depends on a primitive element $\varepsilon$ of the
underlying field $\mathrm{GF}(q^2)$.11
  In the present paper, we first provide a classification of such varieties up
to projective equivalence in finite projective spaces of arbitrary dimension.
Then, we focus on the case $r = 3$ and study the structure of the lines
contained in $\mathcal{H}_\varepsilon^3$; as a consequence, we determine the

Abstract: An independent set in a simple graph $G$ is a set of pairwise non-adjacent
vertices in $G$. The independence polynomial of $G$, denoted by $I_G$ is
defined as $1 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2+\cdots+a_d z^{d}$, where $a_i$ denotes the
number of independent sets with cardinality $i$ and $d$ is the cardinality of a
largest independent set in $G$. This $d$ is known as the independence number of
$G$. Let $G^m$ denote the $m$-times lexicographic product of $G$ with itself.
The independence attractor of $G$, denoted by $\mathcal{A}(G)$ is defined as
$\mathcal{A}(G) = \lim\limits_{m\rightarrow \infty} \{z: I_{G^m}(z)=0\}$, where
the limit is taken with respect to the Hausdorff metric defined on the space of
all compact subsets of the plane. This paper investigates the connectedness of
the independence attractors of all graphs with independence number three. Let
the independence polynomial of $G$ be $1+a_1 z +a_2 z^2 +a_3 z^3$. For $a_1
=3$, $\mathcal{A}(G)$ turns out to be $ \{-1\} \cup \{z: |z+1|=1\} $. For $a_1
>3$, we prove the following.
  If $a_2 ^2 \leq 3 a_1 a_3$, or $3 a_1 a_3 < a_2 ^2 < 4a_3 (a_1 -1)$ then
$\mathcal{A}(G)$ is totally disconnected. For $a_2 ^2 =4a_3 (a_1 -1) $,
$\mathcal{A}(G)$ is connected when $a_1 =5$ and is disconnected but not totally
disconnected for all other values of $a_1$. If $a_2 ^2 > 4a_3 (a_1 -1)$ then
$\mathcal{A}(G)$ can be connected, totally disconnected or disconnected but not
totally disconnected depending on further conditions involving $a_1, a_2$ and
$a_3$. Examples of graphs exhibiting all the possibilities are provided.

Abstract: This article investigates the isomorphism problem for graphs derived from the
four standard graph products: Cartesian, Kronecker (direct), strong, and
lexicographic product. We provide a complete characterization of all simple
connected graphs for which their corresponding products are isomorphic. As a
by-product, we identify a novel family of non-distance-regular graphs that
possess fewer than d+1 distinct distance eigenvalues, where d represents the
diameter of the graph. This result offers a new perspective on Problem 4.3
posed in [2], moving beyond the current approaches.

and analytical techniques, show that this generating function is closely
connected with an interesting class of restricted partitions, namely,
partitions into distinct parts where the number of parts is not a part. We
derive arithmetic properties of the number of such partitions and conjecture an
interesting mod $4$ congruence. Generalizations of most of these results in a

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Let $X$ be a simplicial complex. For $1\le i\le\dim(X)$, let $X(i)$ be the
set of $i$-dimensional faces of $X$, and let $f_i(X)=|X(i)|$. For $0\le i\le
\dim(X)-1$, let $L_i^+(X)$ be the $i$-th upper Laplacian operator of $X$. For
$\sigma\in X$ and $1\le r\le \dim(X)$, we denote by
$\text{deg}_X^{(r)}(\sigma)$ the number of $r$-dimensional faces of $X$
containing $\sigma$. For a symmetric matrix $M\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ and
$1\le i\le n$, let $\lambda_i(M)$ be the $i$-th largest eigenvalue of $M$. We
prove that for every complex $X$, $1\le r\le\dim(X)$, and $1\le k\le
f_{r-1}(X)/(r+1)$, \[ \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i(L_{r-1}^+(X)) \le \max \left\{
\sum_{\sigma\in A} \text{deg}_X^{(r)}(\sigma) :\, A\subset X(r-1),\, |A|=(r+1)k
\right\}. \] This bound is sharp, and it extends a classical result of Anderson
and Morley, corresponding to the special case $k=1,\, r=1$. As a consequence,
we show that for all $1\le r\le \dim(X)$ and $1\le k\le f_{r-1}(X)$, \[
\sum_{i=1}^{k} \lambda_i(L_{r-1}^+(X)) \le f_r(X) + \binom{(r+1)k}{2}. \] In
the case $r=1$, we obtain the following improved bound: for every $k\ge 1$ and
every graph $G=(V,E)$ with $|V|\ge k$, \[
  \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i(L(G)) \leq |E|+k^2, \] where $L(G)=L_0^{+}(G)$ is the
Laplacian matrix of $G$. This improves upon previously known bounds for all
$k\ge 3$, and may be seen as a further step towards Brouwer's conjecture, which
states that $\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i(L(G)) \leq |E|+\binom{k+1}{2}.$
  As an additional application, we show that if $X$ is an $(r+1)$-partite
$r$-dimensional simplicial complex on vertex set $V$, and $1\le k\le
f_{r-1}(X)$, then \[
  \sum_{i=1}^{k} \lambda_i(L_{r-1}^+(X)) \le \sum_{i=1}^k \left|\{v\in V:\,
\text{deg}^{(r)}_X(v)\ge i\}\right|. \] This resolves a special case of a
conjecture of Duval and Reiner, which states that the above inequality holds
for all simplicial complexes.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: We study the canonical form $\Omega$ as a valuation in the context of
scissors congruence for polytopes. We identify the degree of its numerator -
the adjoint polynomial $\operatorname{adj}_P$ - as an important invariant in
this context. More precisely, for a polytope $P$ we define the degree drop that
measures how much smaller than expected the degree of the adjoint polynomial of
$P$ is. We show that this drop behaves well under various operations, such as
decompositions, restrictions to faces, projections, products and Minkowski
sums. Next we define the reduced canonical form $\Omega_0$ and show that it is
a translation-invariant 1-homogeneous valuation on polytopes that vanishes if
and only if $P$ has positive degree drop. Using it we can prove that zonotopes
can be characterized as the $d$-polytopes that have maximal possible degree
drop $d-1$. We obtain a decomposition formula for $\Omega_0$ that expresses it
as a sum of edge-local quantities of $P$. Finally, we discuss valuations
$\Omega_s$ that can distinguish higher values of the degree drop.

Abstract: We prove that the rank polynomial of the lattice of order ideals of a loop
fence poset is unimodal. These posets arise as the in the lattice of good
matchings of loop graphs associated with notched arcs. Equivalently, such
polynomials can be obtained by evaluating all coefficient variables in an
F-polynomial at a single variable q. We also conclude that the rank polynomial
of any tagged arc, whether plain or notched, is not only unimodal but also
satisfies a symmetry condition known as almost interlacing. Furthermore, when
the lamination consists of a single curve, the cluster expansion, evaluated by
setting all cluster variables to 1 and all coefficient variables to q, is also
unimodal. We conjecture that polynomials in this case are log-concave.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Huynh, Joret, Micek, Seweryn, and Wollan (Combinatorica, 2022) introduced a
graph parameter, later referred to as 2-treedepth and denoted
$\mathrm{td}_2(\cdot)$. The parameter is the natural 2-connected version of
treedepth. For every graph, 2-treedepth is at most the treedepth but can be
much smaller: long paths have arbitrary treedepth but 2-treedepth equal to 2.
We prove a converse, showing that every graph $G$ with no induced path on $t$
vertices has treedepth less than $2 \cdot t^{\mathrm{td}_2(G)-1}$. This bound
is best possible as a function of $t$ up to a multiplicative constant.
  Additionally, we give asymptotically tight bounds for the problem of forcing
long induced paths in graphs with long paths and bounded 2-treedepth or bounded
pathwidth. The latter result answers a question of Hilaire and Raymond (E-JC,
2024).

Abstract: Let $m$ and $r$ be integers with $m \ge r \ge 3$ and let $G$ be an
$r$-regular graph of even order. Let $M$ be a matching in $G$ of size $m$ such
that each pair of edges in $M$ is at distance at least $3$. In 2023, Aldred et
al. proved that if $G$ is cyclically $(mr-r+1)$-edge-connected and $G$ is
bipartite, then there exists a perfect matching of $G$ containing $M$. In this
paper, we present non-bipartite analogues of Aldred et al.'s theorem. An odd
ear of $U \subseteq V(G)$ is a path of odd length whose ends lie in $U$ but
whose internal vertices do not, or a cycle of odd length having exactly one
vertex in $U$. Our first result shows that if $G$ is cyclically $(mr - m
+1)$-edge-connected and there exist $mr - \left\lceil \frac{r}{2} \right\rceil
+ 1$ edge-disjoint odd ears of $V(M)$, then $M$ can be extended to a perfect
matching of $G$. We further show that if $G$ contains $mr-r+1$ edge-disjoint
odd ears of $V(M)$ and no cyclic edge cut in $G$ of size less than
$(2m-1)(r-1)$ separates an odd cycle from another cycle, then $M$ can still be
extended to a perfect matching. The second result extends Aldred et al.'s
theorem to non-bipartite graphs in the case $r \ge 4$, and in the case when $r
= 3$ and each pair of edges in $M$ is at distance at least $5$. It is also
shown that the above results hold when $m \le r - 1$, without assuming the
distance condition on $M$.

\deg_G(u)}$ and the variable sum exdeg index $SEI_a(G)$ for $a>0$, $a\neq 1$.
We present several sharp bounds and characterizations of these and related
topological indices on specialized graph classes, including regular graphs,
thorny graphs, and chemical trees. Using the strict convexity of function $f$,
inequalities for degree-based graph invariants $H_f(T)$ are derived under
structural constraints on trees such as branching vertices and maximum degree.
Examples on caterpillar trees illustrate the computation of indices like
$^{m}M_2(G)$, $F(G)$, $M_2(G)$, and others, revealing the interplay between
degree sequences and index values. Additionally, upper and lower bounds on the
Sombor index $SO(G^*)$ of thorny graphs $G^*$ are established as \[
\operatorname{SO} \leqslant \sum_{uv\in
E(G)}\sqrt{\frac{1}{\deg_{G}(u)^2+\deg_{G}(v)^2}+\deg_{G}(u)+\deg_{G}(v)}, \]
  including criteria for equality, with implications for regular and
thorn-regular graphs. The treatment includes detailed formulas, constructive
examples, and inequalities critical for understanding the relationship between
graph topology and vertex-degree-based descriptors.

without the use of computers -- each of the two existing proofs (one due to
Koutschan, Krattenthaler and Schlosser, the other to Corteel, Huang and
Krattenthaler) relies on substantial computer calculations which would be hard
to check directly. In this paper we present a short combinatorial proof that
relies on the second author's factorization theorem and complementation theorem

Abstract: A well-known conjecture of Simon (1994) states that any pure $d$-dimensional
shellable complex on $n$ vertices can be extended to $\Delta_{n-1}^{(d)}$, the
$d$-skeleton of the $(n-1)$-dimensional simplex, by attaching one facet at a
time while maintaining shellability.
  The notion of $k$-decomposability for simplicial complexes, which generalizes
shellability, was introduced by Provan and Billera (1980). Coleman,
Dochtermann, Geist, and Oh (2022) showed that any pure $d$-dimensional
$0$-decomposable complex on $n$ vertices can similarly be extended to
$\Delta_{n-1}^{(d)}$, attaching one facet at a time while preserving
$0$-decomposability.
  In this paper, we investigate the analogous question for $1$-decomposable
complexes. We prove a slightly relaxed version: any pure $d$-dimensional
$1$-decomposable complex on $n$ vertices can be extended to $\Delta_{n + d -
3}^{(d)}$, attaching one facet at a time while maintaining $1$-decomposability.

Hanna and Whitlatch (2024) developed a theory of positive matrices over finite

factorization for a family of the dense cone of Hermitian matrices over
real/complex fields, whose leading principal minors (LPM) are nonzero. Building
on this, we develop a parallel theory within the finite field setting.
Specifically (i) we extend the general Cholesky factorization to the LPM cone
over finite fields which has asymptomatic density $1$. We show that (ii) this
factorization is compatible with the entrywise Frobenius map, recently studied
in the context of positivity preservers by Guillot, Gupta, Vishwakarma, and Yip
[J. Algebra, 2025]. We also (iii) leverage the Cholesky-structures to define
meaningful group operations on the matrix cone, and as an application (iv)
enumerate sub-cones of LPM matrices using our general Cholesky factorizations.

Abstract: We describe some recently discovered connections between one-dimensional
interacting particle models and Macdonald polynomials. The first such model is
the multispecies asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on a ring, linked
to the symmetric Macdonald polynomial $P_{\lambda}(X;q,t)$ through its
partition function. Through this connection, a new formula was found for
$P_{\lambda}$ by generalizing multiline queues, which were introduced by Martin
in 2018 to compute stationary probabilities of the ASEP. The second particle
model is the multispecies totally asymmetric zero range process (TAZRP) on a
ring, which was very recently found to have an analogous connection to the
modified Macdonald polynomial $\widetilde{H}_{\lambda}(X;q,t)$ through its
partition function. This discovery coincided with a new formula for
$\widetilde{H}_{\lambda}$, this time in terms of tableaux with a queue
inversion statistic, which also compute stationary probabilities of the TAZRP.
We explain the plethystic relationship between multiline queues and queue
inversion tableaux, and along the way, derive a new formula for $P_{\lambda}$
using the queue inversion statistic. This plethystic correspondence is closely
related to fusion in the setting of integrable systems.

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable results in various
domains, including robotics, games, natural language processing, and finance.
In the financial domain, this approach has been applied to tasks such as
portfolio optimization, where an agent continuously adjusts the allocation of
assets within a financial portfolio to maximize profit. Numerous studies have
introduced new simulation environments, neural network architectures, and
training algorithms for this purpose. Among these, a domain-specific policy
gradient algorithm has gained significant attention in the research community
for being lightweight, fast, and for outperforming other approaches. However,
recent studies have shown that this algorithm can yield inconsistent results
and underperform, especially when the portfolio does not consist of
cryptocurrencies. One possible explanation for this issue is that the commonly
used state normalization method may cause the agent to lose critical
information about the true value of the assets being traded. This paper
explores this hypothesis by evaluating two of the most widely used
normalization methods across three different markets (IBOVESPA, NYSE, and
cryptocurrencies) and comparing them with the standard practice of normalizing
data before training. The results indicate that, in this specific domain, the
state normalization can indeed degrade the agent's performance.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have gained widespread adoption across various
applications. Despite the success, the potential misuse of T2I models poses
significant risks of generating Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. To
investigate the vulnerability of T2I models, this paper delves into adversarial
attacks to bypass the safety mechanisms under black-box settings. Most previous
methods rely on word substitution to search adversarial prompts. Due to limited
search space, this leads to suboptimal performance compared to gradient-based
training. However, black-box settings present unique challenges to training
gradient-driven attack methods, since there is no access to the internal
architecture and parameters of T2I models. To facilitate the learning of
adversarial prompts in black-box settings, we propose a novel prompt learning
attack framework (PLA), where insightful gradient-based training tailored to
black-box T2I models is designed by utilizing multimodal similarities.
Experiments show that our new method can effectively attack the safety
mechanisms of black-box T2I models including prompt filters and post-hoc safety
checkers with a high success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Malware and cheat developers use fileless execution techniques to evade
traditional, signature-based security products. These methods include various
types of manual mapping, module stomping, and threadless injection which work
entirely within the address space of a legitimate process, presenting a
challenge for detection due to ambiguity between what is legitimate and what
isn't. Existing tools often have weaknesses, such as a dependency on Portable
Executable (PE) structures or a vulnerability to time-of-check-to-time-of-use
(TOCTOU) race conditions where an adversary cleans up before a periodic scan
has the chance to occur. To address this gap, we present RX-INT, a
kernel-assisted system featuring an architecture that provides resilience
against TOCTOU attacks. RX-INT introduces a detection engine that combines a
real-time thread creation monitor with a stateful Virtual Address Descriptor
(VAD) scanner alongside various heuristics within. This engine snapshots both
private and image-backed memory regions, using real-time memory hashing to
detect illicit modifications like module stomping. Critically, we demonstrate a
higher detection rate in certain benchmarks of this approach through a direct
comparison with PE-sieve, a commonly used and powerful memory forensics tool.
In our evaluation, RX-INT successfully detected a manually mapped region that
was not identified by PE-sieve. We then conclude that our architecture
represents a tangible difference in the detection of fileless threats, with
direct applications in the fields of anti-cheat and memory security.

adversary profiles and abilities from existing threat intelligence databases.
This innovative proposal for cyberattack simulation employs a structured

automated attack sequences, creating inferred attack trees from adversary

Abstract: AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software
development, but their safety remains deeply uncertain-especially in
high-stakes domains like cybersecurity. Current red-teaming tools often rely on
fixed benchmarks or unrealistic prompts, missing many real-world
vulnerabilities. We present ASTRA, an automated agent system designed to
systematically uncover safety flaws in AI-driven code generation and security
guidance systems. ASTRA works in three stages: (1) it builds structured
domain-specific knowledge graphs that model complex software tasks and known
weaknesses; (2) it performs online vulnerability exploration of each target
model by adaptively probing both its input space, i.e., the spatial
exploration, and its reasoning processes, i.e., the temporal exploration,
guided by the knowledge graphs; and (3) it generates high-quality
violation-inducing cases to improve model alignment. Unlike prior methods,
ASTRA focuses on realistic inputs-requests that developers might actually
ask-and uses both offline abstraction guided domain modeling and online domain
knowledge graph adaptation to surface corner-case vulnerabilities. Across two
major evaluation domains, ASTRA finds 11-66% more issues than existing
techniques and produces test cases that lead to 17% more effective alignment
training, showing its practical value for building safer AI systems.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: All current detection of backdoor attacks on deep learning models fall under
the category of a non essential features(NEF), which focus on fighting against
simple and efficient vertical class backdoor -- trigger is small, few and not
overlapping with the source. Evade-adaptive backdoor (EAB) attacks have evaded
NEF detection and improved training efficiency. We introduces a precise,
efficient and universal detection and defense framework coined as Isolate
Trigger (IsTr). IsTr aims to find the hidden trigger by breaking the barrier of
the source features. Therefore, it investigates the essence of backdoor
triggering, and uses Steps and Differential-Middle-Slice as components to
update past theories of distance and gradient. IsTr also plays a positive role
in the model, whether the backdoor exists. For example, accurately find and
repair the wrong identification caused by deliberate or unintentional training
in automatic driving. Extensive experiments on robustness scross various tasks,
including MNIST, facial recognition, and traffic sign recognition, confirm the
high efficiency, generality and precision of the IsTr. We rigorously evaluated
the effectiveness of the IsTr against a series of six EAB attacks, including
Badnets, Sin-Wave, Multi-trigger, SSBAs, CASSOCK, HCB. None of these
countermeasures evade, even when attacks are combined and the trigger and
source overlap.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Homomorphic Encryption (HE) prevails in securing Federated Learning (FL), but
suffers from high overhead and adaptation cost. Selective HE methods, which
partially encrypt model parameters by a global mask, are expected to protect
privacy with reduced overhead and easy adaptation. However, in cross-device
scenarios with heterogeneous data and system capabilities, traditional
Selective HE methods deteriorate client straggling, and suffer from degraded HE
overhead reduction performance. Accordingly, we propose SenseCrypt, a
Sensitivity-guided selective Homomorphic EnCryption framework, to adaptively
balance security and HE overhead per cross-device FL client. Given the
observation that model parameter sensitivity is effective for measuring
clients' data distribution similarity, we first design a privacy-preserving
method to respectively cluster the clients with similar data distributions.
Then, we develop a scoring mechanism to deduce the straggler-free ratio of
model parameters that can be encrypted by each client per cluster. Finally, for
each client, we formulate and solve a multi-objective model parameter selection
optimization problem, which minimizes HE overhead while maximizing model
security without causing straggling. Experiments demonstrate that SenseCrypt
ensures security against the state-of-the-art inversion attacks, while
achieving normal model accuracy as on IID data, and reducing training time by
58.4%-88.7% as compared to traditional HE methods.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Gradient inversion attacks pose significant privacy threats to distributed
training frameworks such as federated learning, enabling malicious parties to
reconstruct sensitive local training data from gradient communications between
clients and an aggregation server during the aggregation process. While
traditional encryption-based defenses, such as homomorphic encryption, offer
strong privacy guarantees without compromising model utility, they often incur
prohibitive computational overheads. To mitigate this, selective encryption has
emerged as a promising approach, encrypting only a subset of gradient data
based on the data's significance under a certain metric. However, there have
been few systematic studies on how to specify this metric in practice. This
paper systematically evaluates selective encryption methods with different
significance metrics against state-of-the-art attacks. Our findings demonstrate
the feasibility of selective encryption in reducing computational overhead
while maintaining resilience against attacks. We propose a distance-based
significance analysis framework that provides theoretical foundations for
selecting critical gradient elements for encryption. Through extensive
experiments on different model architectures (LeNet, CNN, BERT, GPT-2) and
attack types, we identify gradient magnitude as a generally effective metric
for protection against optimization-based gradient inversions. However, we also
observe that no single selective encryption strategy is universally optimal
across all attack scenarios, and we provide guidelines for choosing appropriate
strategies for different model architectures and privacy requirements.

Abstract: Keyloggers remain a serious threat in modern cybersecurity, silently
capturing user keystrokes to steal credentials and sensitive information.
Traditional defenses focus mainly on detection and removal, which can halt
malicious activity but do little to engage or mislead adversaries. In this
paper, we present a deception framework that leverages API hooking to intercept
input-related API calls invoked by keyloggers at runtime and inject realistic
decoy keystrokes. A core challenge, however, lies in the increasing adoption of
anti-hooking techniques by advanced keyloggers. Anti-hooking strategies allow
malware to bypass or detect instrumentation. To counter this, we introduce a
hardened hooking layer that detects tampering and rapidly reinstates disrupted
hooks, ensuring continuity of deception. We evaluate our framework against a
custom-built "super keylogger" incorporating multiple evasion strategies, as
well as 50 real-world malware samples spanning ten prominent keylogger
families. Experimental results demonstrate that our system successfully resists
sophisticated bypass attempts, maintains operational stealth, and reliably
deceives attackers by feeding them decoys. The system operates with negligible
performance overhead and no observable impact on user experience. Our findings
show that resilient, runtime deception can play a practical and robust role in
confronting advanced threats.

Abstract: Multivariate Long-Term Time Series Forecasting (MLTSF) models are
increasingly deployed in critical domains such as climate, finance, and
transportation. Although a variety of powerful MLTSF models have been proposed
to improve predictive performance, the robustness of MLTSF models against
malicious backdoor attacks remains entirely unexplored, which is crucial to
ensuring their reliable and trustworthy deployment. To address this gap, we
conduct an in-depth study on backdoor attacks against MLTSF models and propose
the first effective attack method named BadTime. BadTime executes a backdoor
attack by poisoning training data and customizing the backdoor training
process. During data poisoning, BadTime proposes a contrast-guided strategy to
select the most suitable training samples for poisoning, then employs a graph
attention network to identify influential variables for trigger injection.
Subsequently, BadTime further localizes optimal positions for trigger injection
based on lag analysis and proposes a puzzle-like trigger structure that
distributes the trigger across multiple poisoned variables to jointly steer the
prediction of the target variable. During backdoor training, BadTime
alternately optimizes the model and triggers via proposed tailored optimization
objectives. Extensive experiments show that BadTime significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art (SOTA) backdoor attacks on time series forecasting by reducing
MAE by over 50% on target variables and boosting stealthiness by more than 3
times.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: As deep learning-based, data-driven information extraction systems become
increasingly integrated into modern document processing workflows, one primary
concern is the risk of malicious leakage of sensitive private data from these
systems. While some recent works have explored Differential Privacy (DP) to
mitigate these privacy risks, DP-based training is known to cause significant
performance degradation and impose several limitations on standard training
procedures, making its direct application to downstream tasks both difficult
and costly. In this work, we aim to address the above challenges within the
context of document image classification by substituting real private data with
a synthetic counterpart. In particular, we propose to use conditional latent
diffusion models (LDMs) in combination with differential privacy (DP) to
generate class-specific synthetic document images under strict privacy
constraints, which can then be utilized to train a downstream classifier
following standard training procedures. We investigate our approach under
various pretraining setups, including unconditional, class-conditional, and
layout-conditional pretraining, in combination with multiple private training
strategies such as class-conditional and per-label private fine-tuning with
DPDM and DP-Promise algorithms. Additionally, we evaluate it on two well-known
document benchmark datasets, RVL-CDIP and Tobacco3482, and show that it can
generate useful and realistic document samples across various document types
and privacy levels ($\varepsilon \in \{1, 5, 10\}$). Lastly, we show that our
approach achieves substantial performance improvements in downstream
evaluations on small-scale datasets, compared to the direct application of
DP-Adam.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing
raw data, but individual model updates may still leak sensitive information.
Secure aggregation (SecAgg) mitigates this risk by allowing the server to
access only the sum of client updates, thereby concealing individual
contributions. However, a significant vulnerability has recently attracted
increasing attention: when model updates are sparse vectors, a non-zero value
contributed by a single client at a given index can be directly revealed in the
aggregate, enabling precise data reconstruction attacks. In this paper, we
propose a novel enhancement to SecAgg that reveals aggregated values only at
indices with at least $t$ non-zero contributions. Our mechanism introduces a
per-element masking strategy to prevent the exposure of under-contributed
elements, while maintaining modularity and compatibility with many existing
SecAgg implementations by relying solely on cryptographic primitives already
employed in a typical setup. We integrate this mechanism into Flamingo, a
low-round SecAgg protocol, to provide a robust defense against such attacks.
Our analysis and experimental results indicate that the additional
computational and communication overhead introduced by our mechanism remains
within an acceptable range, supporting the practicality of our approach.

Abstract: Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) have attracted significant attention in
response to privacy regulations, driving the development of applications that
prioritize user data protection. At the same time, the information and
communication technology (ICT) sector faces growing pressure to reduce its
environmental footprint, particularly its carbon emissions. While numerous
studies have assessed the energy footprint of various ICT applications, the
environmental footprint of cryptographic PETs remains largely unexplored.
  Our work addresses this gap by proposing a standardized methodology for
evaluating the carbon footprint of PETs. To demonstrate this methodology, we
focus on PETs supporting client-server applications as they are the simplest to
deploy. In particular, we measure the energy consumption and carbon footprint
increase induced by five cryptographic PETs (compared to their non-private
equivalent): HTTPS web browsing, encrypted machine learning (ML) inference,
encrypted ML training, encrypted databases, and encrypted emails. Our findings
reveal significant variability in carbon footprint increases, ranging from a
twofold increase in HTTPS web browsing to a 100,000-fold increase in encrypted
ML.
  Our study provides essential data to help decision-makers assess
privacy-carbon trade-offs in such applications. Finally, we outline key
research directions for developing PETs that balance strong privacy protection
with environmental sustainability.

Abstract: Cross-chain asset exchange is crucial for blockchain interoperability.
Existing solutions rely on trusted third parties and risk asset loss, or use
decentralized alternatives like atomic swaps, which suffer from grief attacks.
Griefing occurs when a party prematurely exits, locking the counterparty's
assets until a timelock expires. Hedged Atomic Swaps mitigate griefing by
introducing a penalty premium; however, they increase the number of
transactions from four (as in Tier Nolan's swap) to six, which in turn
introduces new griefing risks. Grief-Free (GF) Swap reduces this to five
transactions by consolidating assets and premiums on a single chain. However,
no existing protocol achieves grief-free asset exchange in just four
transactions.
  This paper presents 4-Swap, the first cross-chain atomic swap protocol that
is both grief-free and bribery-safe, while completing asset exchange in just
four transactions. By combining the griefing premium and principal into a
single transaction per chain, 4-Swap reduces on-chain transactions, leading to
faster execution compared to previous grief-free solutions. It is fully
compatible with Bitcoin and operates without the need for any new opcodes. A
game-theoretic analysis shows that rational participants have no incentive to
deviate from the protocol, ensuring robust compliance and security.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing actions
present fundamentally distinct governance challenges compared to traditional AI
models. Unlike conventional AI, these systems exhibit emergent and unexpected
behaviors during runtime, introducing novel agent-related risks that cannot be
fully anticipated through pre-deployment governance alone. To address this
critical gap, we introduce MI9, the first fully integrated runtime governance
framework designed specifically for safety and alignment of agentic AI systems.
MI9 introduces real-time controls through six integrated components:
agency-risk index, agent-semantic telemetry capture, continuous authorization
monitoring, Finite-State-Machine (FSM)-based conformance engines,
goal-conditioned drift detection, and graduated containment strategies.
Operating transparently across heterogeneous agent architectures, MI9 enables
the systematic, safe, and responsible deployment of agentic systems in
production environments where conventional governance approaches fall short,
providing the foundational infrastructure for safe agentic AI deployment at
scale. Detailed analysis through a diverse set of scenarios demonstrates MI9's
systematic coverage of governance challenges that existing approaches fail to
address, establishing the technical foundation for comprehensive agentic AI
oversight.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on multimodal large language models exhibit
strong collaboration and performance. However, their growing openness and
interaction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial
attacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as
dedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this
paradigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection,
and (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised,
system-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents
further raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose
Evo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that
enables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than
relying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to
simultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats,
ensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure.
Furthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing
reinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial
training paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS
performance under co-evolving threats. Experiments show that Evo-MARL reduces
attack success rates by up to 22% while boosting accuracy by up to 5% on
reasoning tasks-demonstrating that safety and utility can be jointly improved.

Abstract: Designing effective algorithmic components remains a fundamental obstacle in
tackling NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), where solvers
often rely on carefully hand-crafted strategies. Despite recent advances in
using large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality components, most
approaches restrict the search to a single element - commonly a heuristic
scoring function - thus missing broader opportunities for innovation. In this
paper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy
optimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent
components under a unified objective. To address this, we propose
Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a
novel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based
optimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one
component by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior
updates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This
structured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the
discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions. Experiments across multiple
COP domains show that MOTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting the promise of turn-based, multi-agent prompting for fully
automated solver design.

Abstract: Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration

in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language
Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer
interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is
still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning
over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic
regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior
efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set
of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified
framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop
symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators.
Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models,
highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment,
and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.

Abstract: We observe that MLRMs oriented toward human-centric service are highly
susceptible to user emotional cues during the deep-thinking stage, often
overriding safety protocols or built-in safety checks under high emotional
intensity. Inspired by this key insight, we propose EmoAgent, an autonomous
adversarial emotion-agent framework that orchestrates exaggerated affective
prompts to hijack reasoning pathways. Even when visual risks are correctly
identified, models can still produce harmful completions through emotional
misalignment. We further identify persistent high-risk failure modes in
transparent deep-thinking scenarios, such as MLRMs generating harmful reasoning
masked behind seemingly safe responses. These failures expose misalignments
between internal inference and surface-level behavior, eluding existing
content-based safeguards. To quantify these risks, we introduce three metrics:
(1) Risk-Reasoning Stealth Score (RRSS) for harmful reasoning beneath benign
outputs; (2) Risk-Visual Neglect Rate (RVNR) for unsafe completions despite
visual risk recognition; and (3) Refusal Attitude Inconsistency (RAIC) for
evaluating refusal unstability under prompt variants. Extensive experiments on
advanced MLRMs demonstrate the effectiveness of EmoAgent and reveal deeper
emotional cognitive misalignments in model safety behavior.

Abstract: Intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) such as Siri and Google Assistant are
designed to enhance human capabilities and perform tasks on behalf of users.
The emergence of LLM agents brings new opportunities for the development of
IPAs. While responsive capabilities have been widely studied, proactive
behaviors remain underexplored. Designing an IPA that is proactive,
privacy-preserving, and capable of self-evolution remains a significant
challenge. Designing such IPAs relies on the cognitive architecture of LLM
agents. This work proposes Cognition Forest, a semantic structure designed to
align cognitive modeling with system-level design. We unify cognitive
architecture and system design into a self-reinforcing loop instead of treating
them separately. Based on this principle, we present Galaxy, a framework that
supports multidimensional interactions and personalized capability generation.
Two cooperative agents are implemented based on Galaxy: KoRa, a
cognition-enhanced generative agent that supports both responsive and proactive
skills; and Kernel, a meta-cognition-based meta-agent that enables Galaxy's
self-evolution and privacy preservation. Experimental results show that Galaxy
outperforms multiple state-of-the-art benchmarks. Ablation studies and
real-world interaction cases validate the effectiveness of Galaxy.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have shown promise in automating mobile
tasks but still struggle with input redundancy and decision ambiguity. In this
paper, we present \textbf{RecAgent}, an uncertainty-aware agent that addresses
these issues through adaptive perception. We distinguish two types of
uncertainty in GUI navigation: (1) perceptual uncertainty, caused by input
redundancy and noise from comprehensive screen information, and (2) decision
uncertainty, arising from ambiguous tasks and complex reasoning. To reduce
perceptual uncertainty, RecAgent employs a component recommendation mechanism
that identifies and focuses on the most relevant UI elements. For decision
uncertainty, it uses an interactive module to request user feedback in
ambiguous situations, enabling intent-aware decisions. These components are
integrated into a unified framework that proactively reduces input complexity
and reacts to high-uncertainty cases via human-in-the-loop refinement.
Additionally, we propose a dataset called \textbf{ComplexAction} to evaluate
the success rate of GUI agents in executing specified single-step actions
within complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
our approach. The dataset and code will be available at

enhancement. Specifically, we first propose an automatic pipeline to generate
the verifiable trajectory for training. And then, we propose efficient
step-wise reinforcement learning to alleviate the significant computational
requirements for long-horizon training. In the end, we propose the enhancement
method to merge the grounding and planning ability into one model without any
extra training. Accordingly, based on our proposed innovation of data
generation, training strategy, and enhancement, we get the Selfevolution Agent
(SEA) for computer use with only 7B parameters, which outperforms models with
the same number of parameters and has comparable performance to larger ones. We
will make the models' weight and related codes open-source in the future.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into digital
learning environments, the personalization of learning content to reflect
learners' individual career goals offers promising potential to enhance
engagement and long-term motivation. In our study, we investigate how career
goal-based content adaptation in learning systems based on generative AI
(GenAI) influences learner engagement, satisfaction, and study efficiency. The
mixed-methods experiment involved more than 4,000 learners, with one group
receiving learning scenarios tailored to their career goals and a control
group. Quantitative results show increased session duration, higher
satisfaction ratings, and a modest reduction in study duration compared to
standard content. Qualitative analysis highlights that learners found the
personalized material motivating and practical, enabling deep cognitive
engagement and strong identification with the content. These findings
underscore the value of aligning educational content with learners' career
goals and suggest that scalable AI personalization can bridge academic
knowledge and workplace applicability.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have excelled in natural
language processing tasks but face significant challenges in complex reasoning
tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. To address these
limitations, we propose KG-Augmented Executable Chain-of-Thought (KGA-ECoT), a
novel framework that enhances code generation through knowledge graphs and
improves mathematical reasoning via executable code. KGA-ECoT decomposes
problems into a Structured Task Graph, leverages efficient GraphRAG for precise
knowledge retrieval from mathematical libraries, and generates verifiable code
to ensure computational accuracy. Evaluations on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KGA-ECoT significantly outperforms
existing prompting methods, achieving absolute accuracy improvements ranging
from several to over ten percentage points. Further analysis confirms the
critical roles of GraphRAG in enhancing code quality and external code
execution in ensuring precision. These findings collectively establish KGA-ECoT
as a robust and highly generalizable framework for complex mathematical
reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent studies have extended the application of large language models (LLMs)
to geographic problems, revealing surprising geospatial competence even without
explicit spatial supervision. However, LLMs still face challenges in spatial
consistency, multi-hop reasoning, and geographic bias. To address these issues,
we propose GeoSR, a self-refining agentic reasoning framework that embeds core
geographic principles -- most notably Tobler's First Law of Geography -- into
an iterative prediction loop. In GeoSR, the reasoning process is decomposed
into three collaborating agents: (1) a variable-selection agent that selects
relevant covariates from the same location; (2) a point-selection agent that
chooses reference predictions at nearby locations generated by the LLM in
previous rounds; and (3) a refine agent that coordinates the iterative
refinement process by evaluating prediction quality and triggering further
rounds when necessary. This agentic loop progressively improves prediction
quality by leveraging both spatial dependencies and inter-variable
relationships. We validate GeoSR on tasks ranging from physical-world property
estimation to socioeconomic prediction. Experimental results show consistent
improvements over standard prompting strategies, demonstrating that
incorporating geostatistical priors and spatially structured reasoning into
LLMs leads to more accurate and equitable geospatial predictions. The code of
GeoSR is available at https://github.com/JinfanTang/GeoSR.

Abstract: Automated grading systems can efficiently score short-answer responses, yet
they often fail to indicate when a grading decision is uncertain or potentially
contentious. We introduce semantic entropy, a measure of variability across
multiple GPT-4-generated explanations for the same student response, as a proxy
for human grader disagreement. By clustering rationales via entailment-based
similarity and computing entropy over these clusters, we quantify the diversity
of justifications without relying on final output scores. We address three
research questions: (1) Does semantic entropy align with human grader
disagreement? (2) Does it generalize across academic subjects? (3) Is it
sensitive to structural task features such as source dependency? Experiments on
the ASAP-SAS dataset show that semantic entropy correlates with rater
disagreement, varies meaningfully across subjects, and increases in tasks
requiring interpretive reasoning. Our findings position semantic entropy as an
interpretable uncertainty signal that supports more transparent and trustworthy
AI-assisted grading workflows.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Reactive synthesis from Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) can
be reduced to a two-player game over a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) of
the LTLf specification. The primary challenge here is DFA construction, which
is 2EXPTIME-complete in the worst case. Existing techniques either construct
the DFA compositionally before solving the game, leveraging automata
minimization to mitigate state-space explosion, or build the DFA incrementally
during game solving to avoid full DFA construction. However, neither is
dominant. In this paper, we introduce a compositional on-the-fly synthesis
framework that integrates the strengths of both approaches, focusing on large
conjunctions of smaller LTLf formulas common in practice. This framework
applies composition during game solving instead of automata (game arena)
construction. While composing all intermediate results may be necessary in the
worst case, pruning these results simplifies subsequent compositions and
enables early detection of unrealizability. Specifically, the framework allows
two composition variants: pruning before composition to take full advantage of
minimization or pruning during composition to guide on-the-fly synthesis.
Compared to state-of-the-art synthesis solvers, our framework is able to solve
a notable number of instances that other solvers cannot handle. A detailed
analysis shows that both composition variants have unique merits.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Open-domain Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) faces significant challenges in
an ever-changing world, especially when considering the continual emergence of
new entities in daily news. Existing approaches for KGC mainly rely on
pretrained language models' parametric knowledge, pre-constructed queries, or
single-step retrieval, typically requiring substantial supervision and training
data. Even so, they often fail to capture comprehensive and up-to-date
information about unpopular and/or emerging entities. To this end, we introduce
Agentic Reasoning for Emerging Entities (AgREE), a novel agent-based framework
that combines iterative retrieval actions and multi-step reasoning to
dynamically construct rich knowledge graph triplets. Experiments show that,
despite requiring zero training efforts, AgREE significantly outperforms
existing methods in constructing knowledge graph triplets, especially for
emerging entities that were not seen during language models' training
processes, outperforming previous methods by up to 13.7%. Moreover, we propose
a new evaluation methodology that addresses a fundamental weakness of existing
setups and a new benchmark for KGC on emerging entities. Our work demonstrates
the effectiveness of combining agent-based reasoning with strategic information
retrieval for maintaining up-to-date knowledge graphs in dynamic information
environments.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: AI agents deployed in assistive roles often have to collaborate with other
agents (humans, AI systems) without prior coordination. Methods considered
state of the art for such ad hoc teamwork often pursue a data-driven approach
that needs a large labeled dataset of prior observations, lacks transparency,
and makes it difficult to rapidly revise existing knowledge in response to
changes. As the number of agents increases, the complexity of decision-making
makes it difficult to collaborate effectively. This paper advocates leveraging
the complementary strengths of knowledge-based and data-driven methods for
reasoning and learning for ad hoc teamwork. For any given goal, our
architecture enables each ad hoc agent to determine its actions through
non-monotonic logical reasoning with: (a) prior commonsense domain-specific
knowledge; (b) models learned and revised rapidly to predict the behavior of
other agents; and (c) anticipated abstract future goals based on generic
knowledge of similar situations in an existing foundation model. We
experimentally evaluate our architecture's capabilities in VirtualHome, a
realistic physics-based 3D simulation environment.

Abstract: Circuit Satisfiability (CSAT) plays a pivotal role in Electronic Design
Automation. The standard workflow for solving CSAT problems converts circuits
into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and employs generic SAT solvers powered by
Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL). However, this process inherently
discards rich structural and functional information, leading to suboptimal
solver performance. To address this limitation, we introduce CASCAD, a novel
circuit-aware SAT solving framework that directly leverages circuit-level
conditional probabilities computed via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By
explicitly modeling gate-level conditional probabilities, CASCAD dynamically
guides two critical CDCL heuristics -- variable phase selection and clause
managementto significantly enhance solver efficiency. Extensive evaluations on
challenging real-world Logical Equivalence Checking (LEC) benchmarks
demonstrate that CASCAD reduces solving times by up to 10x compared to
state-of-the-art CNF-based approaches, achieving an additional 23.5% runtime
reduction via our probability-guided clause filtering strategy. Our results
underscore the importance of preserving circuit-level structural insights
within SAT solvers, providing a robust foundation for future improvements in
SAT-solving efficiency and EDA tool design.

domain-specific AI alignment. It establishes the Biomedical Multi-Capability
Convergence Theorem, proving orthogonal gradient spaces are essential to
prevent capability interference for safe deployment. Key innovations include:
(1) Medical Knowledge Grounded Synthetic Generation (MKGSG), extending
Source2Synth with clinical workflow constraints and medical ontology validation

Optimization, deriving optimal hybrid reward weighting to maintain
orthogonality in RL, using a reward model with rule-based and model-based
scores adapted to biomedical tasks. Mathematical analysis proves Pareto-optimal
convergence, preserving performance across capabilities. It achieves
state-of-the-art results in its parameter class: domain expertise (80.95%
BIOMED-MMLU, +15.32% over baseline), reasoning (61.94%, +7.75%), instruction
following (67.95%, +6.44%), and integration (86.7%, +18.5%). Theoretical safety
guarantees include bounds on capability preservation and clinical accuracy.
Real-world deployment yields 78% cost reduction, 23% improved diagnostic
accuracy, and 89% clinician acceptance. This work provides a principled
methodology for biomedical AI alignment, enabling efficient reasoning with
essential safety and reliability, with the 0.5B model version to be released.

Abstract: Recent research has developed benchmarks for memory-augmented reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithms, providing Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP) environments where agents depend on past observations to make
decisions. While many benchmarks incorporate sufficiently complex real-world
problems, they lack controllability over the degree of challenges posed to
memory models. In contrast, synthetic environments enable fine-grained
manipulation of dynamics, making them critical for detailed and rigorous
evaluation of memory-augmented RL. Our study focuses on POMDP synthesis with
three key contributions:
  1. A theoretical framework for analyzing POMDPs, grounded in Memory Demand
Structure (MDS), transition invariance, and related concepts; 2. A methodology
leveraging linear process dynamics, state aggregation, and reward
redistribution to construct customized POMDPs with predefined properties; 3.
Empirically validated series of POMDP environments with increasing difficulty
levels, designed based on our theoretical insights. Our work clarifies the
challenges of memory-augmented RL in solving POMDPs, provides guidelines for
analyzing and designing POMDP environments, and offers empirical support for
selecting memory models in RL tasks.

Abstract: Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic
heuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive
traps. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative
Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from
probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking "Which
answer is most likely?", DRN asks "Which hypothesis has the most internally
consistent evidence?". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly
tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing
hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our
approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative
model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a
lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs.
Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to
expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over
standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with
Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most
challenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional
training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable
reasoning principles. We position DRN as a foundational, verifiable System 2
reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: While generalist foundation models like Gemini and GPT-4o demonstrate
impressive multi-modal competence, existing evaluations fail to test their
intelligence in dynamic, interactive worlds. Static benchmarks lack agency,
while interactive benchmarks suffer from a severe modal bottleneck, typically
ignoring crucial auditory and temporal cues. To bridge this evaluation chasm,
we introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate,
but to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the
full sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence,
OmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create
scenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine
cross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal
models reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on
high-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges
requiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this
fragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic
performance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive
"less is more" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically
improve performance. Our findings suggest that the path toward robust AGI
requires a research focus beyond scaling to explicitly address synergistic
fusion. Our platform is available for anonymous review at

Abstract: Whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems can possess consciousness is a

(latent-emergent), and P (phenomenological-structural) - collectively termed
SLP-tests, which assess whether an AI system instantiates interface
representations that facilitate consciousness-like properties. Drawing on
category theory, we model interface representations as mappings between
relational substrates (RS) and observable behaviors, akin to specific types of
abstraction layers. The SLP-tests collectively operationalize subjective
experience not as an intrinsic property of physical systems but as a functional
interface to a relational entity.

Abstract: Graphical user interface visual grounding (GUI-VG), a core capability for GUI
agents, has primarily relied on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs), which demands extensive data curation and
significant training costs. However, as MLLMs continue to advance and even
cover GUI domains during pretraining, the necessity of exhaustive SFT
post-training becomes increasingly questionable. Meanwhile, recent successes of
rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) suggest a more efficient
alternative. Despite this promise, the optimal manner of applying RFT for
GUI-VG remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GuirlVG, a
reinforcement learning-based GUI-VG method built on a systematic empirical
study and a novel stabilization technique. We find that naive application of
RFT underperforms the SFT baseline, motivating a deeper exploration. First, we
decompose RFT into its core components and analyze the optimal formulation of
each. Second, we propose a novel Adversarial KL Factor that dynamically
stabilizes training to mitigate reward over-optimization. Third, we further
explore the training configurations of RFT to enhance effectiveness. Extensive
experiments show that GuirlVG, with only 5.2K training samples, outperforms SFT
methods trained on over 10M samples, achieving a 7.7% improvement on
ScreenSpot, a 17.2% improvement on ScreenSpotPro, and 91.9% accuracy on
ScreenSpotV2.

Abstract: Frontier LLMs only recently enabled serviceable, autonomous web agents. At
that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest
interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application

$\unicode{x2013}$ referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are
premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual
cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing
relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code
interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML,
impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables
reliable implementation with web agents to date.
  We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a
GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web
dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a
grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) $\unicode{x2013}$ within the same input
token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations
$\unicode{x2013}$ one token order above, but within the model's context window
$\unicode{x2013}$ outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover,
yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.

Abstract: High-quality, multi-turn instructional dialogues between novices and experts
are essential for developing AI systems that support teaching, learning, and
decision-making. These dialogues often involve scaffolding -- the process by
which an expert supports a novice's thinking through questions, feedback, and
step-by-step guidance. However, such data are scarce due to privacy concerns in
recording and the vulnerability inherent in help-seeking. We present
SimInstruct, a scalable, expert-in-the-loop tool for collecting scaffolding
dialogues. Using teaching development coaching as an example domain,
SimInstruct simulates novice instructors via LLMs, varying their teaching
challenges and LLM's persona traits, while human experts provide multi-turn
feedback, reasoning, and instructional support. This design enables the
creation of realistic, pedagogically rich dialogues without requiring real
novice participants. Our results reveal that persona traits, such as
extroversion and introversion, meaningfully influence how experts engage.
Compared to real mentoring recordings, SimInstruct dialogues demonstrate
comparable pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth. Experts also reported the
process as engaging and reflective, improving both data quality and their own
professional insight. We further fine-tuned a LLaMA model to be an expert model
using the augmented dataset, which outperformed GPT-4o in instructional
quality. Our analysis highlights GPT-4o's limitations in weak reflective
questioning, overuse of generic praise, a condescending tone, and a tendency to
overwhelm novices with excessive suggestions.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated a latent capacity for complex
reasoning by spontaneously exhibiting cognitive behaviors such as step-by-step
reasoning, reflection, and backtracking, commonly referred to as "Aha Moments".
However, such emergent behaviors remain unregulated and uncontrolled, often
resulting in overthinking, where the model continues generating redundant
reasoning content even after reaching reliable conclusions. This leads to
excessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical
deployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory
mechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their
reasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To
address this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),
which explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and
control components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control
strategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction
mechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and
delegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling
the construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a
structured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised
fine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial
meta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment
Policy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control
behavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.
Experiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained
with MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional
J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution
of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to
reality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computing devices (e.g., computers and
mobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g.,
Graphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate
tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey
of these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the
fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the
environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential
capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine
methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific
foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation
protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse
tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions
for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and
self-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents
research, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial
development. An open-source GitHub repository is maintained as a dynamic

Abstract: As the use of AI systems in society grows, addressing potential biases that
emerge from data or are learned by models is essential to prevent systematic
disadvantages against specific groups. Several notions of (un)fairness have
been proposed in the literature, alongside corresponding algorithmic methods
for detecting and mitigating unfairness, but, with very few exceptions, these
tend to ignore transparency. Instead, interpretability and explainability are
core requirements for algorithmic fairness, even more so than for other
algorithmic solutions, given the human-oriented nature of fairness. In this
paper, we contribute a novel interpretable, explainable method for bias
detection relying on debates about the presence of bias against individuals,
based on the values of protected features for the individuals and others in
their neighbourhoods. Our method builds upon techniques from formal and
computational argumentation, whereby debates result from arguing about biases
within and across neighbourhoods. We provide formal, quantitative, and
qualitative evaluations of our method, highlighting its strengths in
performance against baselines, as well as its interpretability and
explainability.

Abstract: Fostering students' abilities for knowledge integration and transfer in
complex problem-solving scenarios is a core objective of modern education, and
interdisciplinary STEM is a key pathway to achieve this, yet it requires expert
guidance that is difficult to scale. While LLMs offer potential in this regard,
their true capability for guided instruction remains unclear due to the lack of
an effective evaluation benchmark. To address this, we introduce SID, the first
benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the higher-order guidance
capabilities of LLMs in multi-turn, interdisciplinary Socratic dialogues. Our
contributions include a large-scale dataset of 10,000 dialogue turns across 48
complex STEM projects, a novel annotation schema for capturing deep pedagogical
features, and a new suite of evaluation metrics (e.g., X-SRG). Baseline
experiments confirm that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to execute
effective guided dialogues that lead students to achieve knowledge integration
and transfer. This highlights the critical value of our benchmark in driving
the development of more pedagogically-aware LLMs.

Abstract: Reasoning is a critical capability of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) for solving complex multimodal tasks, and judging the correctness of
reasoning steps is crucial for improving this capability. Recently, MLLM-based
process judges (MPJs) have been widely used to assess the correctness of
reasoning steps in multimodal tasks. Therefore, evaluating MPJs is important
for identifying their limitations and guiding future improvements. However,
existing benchmarks for MPJs mainly focus on tasks such as step correctness
classification and reasoning process search, while overlooking a key aspect:
whether the confidence scores produced by MPJs at the step level are reliable.
To address this gap, we propose ConfProBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
designed to systematically evaluate the reliability of step-level confidence
scores generated by MPJs. Our benchmark constructs three types of adversarially
perturbed reasoning steps: Synonym Substitution, Syntactic Transformation, and
Image Perturbation, to test the robustness of MPJ confidence under
perturbations. In addition, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics:
Confidence Robustness Score (CRS), Confidence Sensitivity Score (CSS), and
Confidence Calibration Score (CCS), which evaluate robustness, sensitivity, and
calibration, respectively. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including
both proprietary and open-source models. Experiments reveal limitations in
current MPJs' confidence performance and offer competitive baselines to support
future research.

Abstract: A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for
modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most
LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for
coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards,
which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration.
To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent,
multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO),
to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL
techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate
that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality
responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the
door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated
challenges.

Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents
(CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled
data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software,
particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge,
we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to
autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software.
Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel
software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new
software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle
auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we
design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a
Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks.
The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of
adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist
training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from
specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA
capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately
achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on
their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across
five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a
significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a
competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.
