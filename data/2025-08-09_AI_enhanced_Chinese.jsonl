Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation\necosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities,\nsuch as \"Tendency to hallucinate\" (53.7% of the corpus) and \"Discriminatory\nbias\" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously\nneglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios,\nincluding evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI\ndevelopment, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus.
