Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: It is commonly accepted that some phenomena are social: for example,
individuals' smoking habits often correlate with those of their peers. Such
correlations can have a variety of explanations, such as direct contagion or
shared socioeconomic circumstances. The network linear-in-means model is a
workhorse statistical model which incorporates these peer effects by including
average neighborhood characteristics as regressors. Although the model's
parameters are identifiable under mild structural conditions on the network, it
remains unclear whether identification ensures reliable estimation in the
"infill" asymptotic setting, where a single network grows in size. We show that
when covariates are i.i.d. and the average network degree of nodes increases
with the population size, standard estimators suffer from bias or slow
convergence rates due to asymptotic collinearity induced by network averaging.
As an alternative, we demonstrate that linear-in-sums models, which are based
on aggregate rather than average neighborhood characteristics, do not exhibit
such issues as long as the network degrees have some nontrivial variation, a
condition satisfied by most network models.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to establish a general asymptotic
representation (\textit{GAR}) for a wide range of statistics, employing two
fundamental processes: the functional empirical process (\textit{fep}) and the
residual functional empirical process introduced by Lo and Sall (2010a, 2010b),
denoted as \textit{lrfep}. The functional empirical process (\textit{fep}) is
defined as follows:
  $$ \mathbb{G}_n(h)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{j=1}^{n}
\{h(X_j)-\mathbb{E}h(X_j)\}, $$
  \Bin [where $X$, $X_1$, $\cdots$, $X_n$ is a sample from a random $d$-vectors
$X$ of size $(n+1)$ with $n\geq 1$ and $h$ is a measurable function defined on
$\mathbb{R}^d$ such that $\mathbb{E}h(X)^2<+\infty$]. It is a powerful tool for
deriving asymptotic laws. An earlier and simpler version of this paper focused
on the application of the (\textit{fep}) to statistics $J_n$ that can be turned
into an asymptotic algebraic expression of empirical functions of the form
  $$ J_n=\mathbb{E}h(X) + n^{-1/2} \mathbb{G}_n(h) + o_{\mathbb{P}}(n^{-1/2}).
\ \ \ \textit{SGAR} $$
  \Bin However, not all statistics, in particular welfare indexes, conform to
this form. In many scenarios, functions of the order statistics $X_{1,n}\leq$,
$\cdots$, $\leq X_{n,n}$ are involved, resulting in $L$-statistics. In such
cases, the (\textit{fep}) can still be utilized, but in combination with the
related residual functional empirical process introduced by Lo and Sall (2010a,
2010b). This combination leads to general asymptotic representations (GAR) for
a wide range of statistical indexes
  $$ J_n=\mathbb{E}h(X) + n^{-1/2} \biggr(\mathbb{G}_n(h) + \int_{0}^{1}
\mathbb{G}_n(\tilde{f}_s) \ell(s) \ ds + o_{\mathbb{P}}(1)\biggr), \ \

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: This paper considers generalizations of the functional equations that
characterize the lack-of-memory properties at univariate and bivariate levels.
Specifically, we extend the univariate functional equation introduced by
Kaminsky (1983) (that characterizes the Gompertz distribution) and the
corresponding bivariate strong and weak versions later studied in Marshall and
Olkin (2015) by allowing the conditional survival distribution to be a fully
general time dependent distortion of the unconditional one: in particular, we
show that the solutions of these generalized functional equations coincide with
the solutions of the functional equations studied in Ricci (2024). Since the
univariate functional equation leads only to a trivial case and the solutions
of the strong bivariate functional equation have been already studied in the
literature, the analysis is focused on the weak bivariate case, where joint
residual lifetimes are conditioned on survival beyond a common threshold t. In
view of potential applications to insurance risk analysis, the impact of the
time dependent distortion on the aging properties of the associated
distribution is analized as well as the time dependent dependence structure of
the residual lifetimes through time-varying versions of the Kendall's function
and of the tail dependence coefficients. Many examples are provided and a wide
family of bivariate survival distributions satisfying the generalized weak
functional equation is constructed through a mixing approach.

regular enough covariance function, a sharper risk bound is established on the
estimator of $b_0'$, and a model selection procedure is provided with
theoretical guarantees.

Result: Error processing this paper.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Prediction sets based on full conformal prediction have seen an increasing
interest in statistical learning due to their universal marginal coverage
guarantees. However, practitioners have refrained from using it in applications
for two reasons: Firstly, it comes at very high computational costs, exceeding
even that of cross-validation. Secondly, an applicant is typically not
interested in a marginal coverage guarantee which averages over all possible
(but not available) training data sets, but rather in a guarantee conditional
on the specific training data. This work tackles these problems by, firstly,
showing that full conformal prediction sets are conditionally conservative
given the training data if the conformity score is stochastically bounded and
satisfies a stability condition. Secondly, we propose an approximation for the
full conformal prediction set that has asymptotically the same training
conditional coverage as full conformal prediction under the stability
assumption derived before, and can be computed more easily. Furthermore, we
show that under the stability assumption, $n$-fold cross-conformal prediction
also has the same asymptotic training conditional coverage guarantees as full
conformal prediction. If the conformity score is defined as the out-of-sample
prediction error, our approximation of the full conformal set coincides with
the symmetrized Jackknife. We conclude that for this conformity score, if based
on a stable prediction algorithm, full-conformal, $n$-fold cross-conformal, the
Jackknife+, our approximation formula, and hence also the Jackknife, all yield
the same asymptotic training conditional coverage guarantees.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: We study a stochastic optimal control problem with the state constrained to a
smooth, compact domain. The control influences both the drift and a possibly
degenerate, control-dependent dispersion matrix, leading to a fully nonlinear,
degenerate elliptic Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation with a nontrivial
Neumann boundary condition. Although these features have been studied
separately, this work provides the first unified treatment combining them all.
We establish that the optimal value function associated with the control
problem is the unique viscosity solution of the HJB equation with a nontrivial
Neumann boundary condition, and we present an illustrative example
demonstrating the applicability of the framework.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: We study the computation of equilibria in exchange markets with divisible
goods and players endowed with heterogeneous utilities. In this paper, we
revisit the polynomial-time interior-point strategies that update \emph{only}
the prices, mirroring the t\^atonnement process. The key ingredient is the
\emph{implicit barrier} inherent in the utility maximization: the utility turns
unbounded when the goods are almost free of charge. Focusing on a ubiquitous
class of utilities, we formalize this observation into Scaled Lipschitz
Continuity for utility maximization from both the primal and dual perspectives.
A companion result suggests that no additional effort is required for computing
high-order derivatives; all the necessary information is readily available when
collecting the best responses. To tackle the Newton systems, we present an
explicitly invertible approximation of the Hessian operator with high
probability guarantees, and a scaling matrix that minimizes the condition
number of the linear system. Building on these tools, we design two inexact
interior-point methods. One such method has O(ln(1/{\epsilon})) complexity
rate. Under mild conditions, the other method achieves a non-asymptotic
superlinear convergence rate. Extensions and preliminary experiments are
presented.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a cornerstone of large-scale
optimization, yet its theoretical behavior under heavy-tailed noise -- common
in modern machine learning and reinforcement learning -- remains poorly
understood. In this work, we rigorously investigate whether vanilla SGD, devoid
of any adaptive modifications, can provably succeed under such adverse
stochastic conditions. Assuming only that stochastic gradients have bounded
$p$-th moments for some $p \in (1, 2]$, we establish sharp convergence
guarantees for (projected) SGD across convex, strongly convex, and non-convex
problem classes. In particular, we show that SGD achieves minimax optimal
sample complexity under minimal assumptions in the convex and strongly convex
regimes: $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{p}{p-1}})$ and
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{p}{2(p-1)}})$, respectively. For non-convex
objectives under H\"older smoothness, we prove convergence to a stationary
point with rate $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{2p}{p-1}})$, and complement
this with a matching lower bound specific to SGD with arbitrary polynomial
step-size schedules. Finally, we consider non-convex Mini-batch SGD under
standard smoothness and bounded central moment assumptions, and show that it
also achieves a comparable $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{2p}{p-1}})$ sample
complexity with a potential improvement in the smoothness constant. These
results challenge the prevailing view that heavy-tailed noise renders SGD
ineffective, and establish vanilla SGD as a robust and theoretically principled
baseline -- even in regimes where the variance is unbounded.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Within the framework of the Augmented Lagrangian (AL), we introduce a novel
distributed optimization method called Distributed Augmented Lagrangian
Decomposition (DALD). We provide a rigorous convergence proof for the standard
version of this method, which is designed to tackle general constrained
optimization problems. To address the high iteration costs in early stages, we
propose several accelerated variants of DALD that enhances efficiency without
compromising theoretical guarantees, supported by a comprehensive convergence
analysis. To facilitate the description of the distributed optimization
process, the concept of hierarchical coordination networks is introduced,
integrating hierarchical matrix concepts to aid in this explanation. We further
explore and expand the applicability of the DALD method and demonstrate how it
unifies existing distributed optimization theories within the AL framework. The
effectiveness and applicability of the proposed distributed optimization method
and its variants are further validated through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence of the efficient solutions for
polynomial vector optimization problems on a nonempty closed constraint set
without any convexity and compactness assumptions. We first introduce the
relative regularity conditions for vector optimization problems whose objective
functions are a vector polynomial and investigate their properties and
characterizations. Moreover, we establish relationships between the relative
regularity conditions, Palais-Smale condition, weak Palais-Smale condition,
M-tameness and properness with respect to some index set. Under the relative
regularity and non-regularity conditions, we establish nonemptiness of the
efficient solution sets of the polynomial vector optimization problems
respectively. As a by-product, we infer Frank-Wolfe type theorems for a
non-convex polynomial vector optimization problem. Finally, we study the local
properties and genericity characteristics of the relative regularity
conditions.

established for homogeneous linear systems with purely quadratic cost
functionals. We extend the results to the current situation. It turns out that
some of the results are new even for the cases without regime switchings.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: It is reported that dynamical systems over digraphs have superior performance
in terms of system damping and tolerance to time delays if the underlying graph
Laplacian has a purely real spectrum. This paper investigates the topological
conditions under which digraphs possess real or complex Laplacian spectra. We
derive sufficient conditions for digraphs, which possibly contain self-loops
and negative-weighted edges, to have real Laplacian spectra. The established
conditions generally imply that a real Laplacian spectrum is linked to the
absence of the so-called digon sign-asymmetric interactions and non-strong
connectivity in any subgraph of the digraph. Then, two classes of digraphs with
complex Laplacian spectra are identified, which imply that the occurrence of
directed cycles is a major factor to cause complex Laplacian eigenvalues.
Moreover, we extend our analysis to multilayer digraphs, where strategies for
preserving real/complex spectra from graph interconnection are proposed.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that the obtained results can effectively
guide the redesign of digraph topologies for a better performance.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: In recent years, stabilizing unknown dynamical systems has became a critical
problem in control systems engineering. Addressing this for linear
time-invariant (LTI) systems is an essential fist step towards solving similar
problems for more complex systems. In this paper, we develop a model-free
reinforcement learning algorithm to compute stabilizing feedback gains for
stochastic LTI systems with unknown system matrices. This algorithm proceeds by
solving a series of discounted stochastic linear quadratic (SLQ) optimal
control problems via policy iteration (PI). And the corresponding discount
factor gradually decreases according to an explicit rule, which is derived from
the equivalent condition in verifying the stabilizability. We prove that this
method can return a stabilizer after finitely many steps. Finally, a numerical
example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources into transmission grid
operations presents a complex challenge, particularly in the context of
reactive power procurement for voltage support. This paper addresses this
challenge by formulating the voltage regulation problem as a Stackelberg game,
where the Transmission System Operator (TSO) designs incentives to guide the
reactive power responses of Distribution System Operators (DSOs). We utilize a
gradient-based iterative algorithm that updates the incentives to ensure that
DSOs adjust their reactive power injections to maintain voltage stability. We
incorporate principles from online feedback optimization to enable real-time
implementation, utilizing voltage measurements in both TSO's and DSOs'
policies. This approach not only enhances the robustness against model
uncertainties and changing operating conditions but also facilitates the
co-design of incentives and automation. Numerical experiments on a 5-bus
transmission grid demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving
voltage regulation while accommodating the strategic interactions of
self-interested DSOs.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: This paper studies the finite-horizon robust optimal control of linear
systems subject to model mismatch and additive stochastic disturbances.
Utilizing the system level synthesis (SLS) parameterization, we propose a novel
SLS design using output-feedback affine control policy and extend it to a
distributionally robust setting to improve system resilience by minimizing the
cost function while ensuring constraint satisfaction against the worst-case
uncertainty distribution. The scopes of model mismatch and stochastic
disturbances are quantified using the 1-norm and a Wasserstein metric-based
ambiguity set, respectively. For the closed-loop dynamics, we analyze the
distributional shift between the predicted output-input response -- computed
using nominal parameters and empirical disturbance samples -- and the actual
closed-loop distribution, highlighting its dependence on model mismatch and SLS
parameterization. Assuming convex and Lipschitz continuous cost functions and
constraints, we derive a tractable reformulation of the distributionally robust
SLS (DR-SLS) problem by leveraging tools from robust control and
distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Numerical experiments validate the
performance and robustness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Biclustering, also known as co-clustering or two-way clustering,
simultaneously partitions the rows and columns of a data matrix to reveal
submatrices with coherent patterns. Incorporating background knowledge into
clustering to enhance solution quality and interpretability has attracted
growing interest in mathematical optimization and machine learning research.
Extending this paradigm to biclustering enables prior information to guide the
joint grouping of rows and columns. We study constrained biclustering with
pairwise constraints, namely must-link and cannot-link constraints, which
specify whether objects should belong to the same or different biclusters. As a
model problem, we address the constrained version of the k-densest disjoint
biclique problem, which aims to identify k disjoint complete bipartite
subgraphs (called bicliques) in a weighted complete bipartite graph, maximizing
the total density while satisfying pairwise constraints. We propose both exact
and heuristic algorithms. The exact approach is a tailored branch-and-cut
algorithm based on a low-dimensional semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation,
strengthened with valid inequalities and solved in a cutting-plane fashion.
Exploiting integer programming tools, a rounding scheme converts SDP solutions
into feasible biclusterings at each node. For large-scale instances, we
introduce an efficient heuristic based on the low-rank factorization of the
SDP. The resulting nonlinear optimization problem is tackled with an augmented
Lagrangian method, where the subproblem is solved by decomposition through a
block-coordinate projected gradient algorithm. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that the exact method significantly
outperforms general-purpose solvers, while the heuristic achieves high-quality
solutions efficiently on large instances.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: A well-known conjecture of Gross and Zagier states that the values of the
higher automorphic Green's function at pairs of points with complex
multiplication in the upper half-plane are proportional to the logarithm of an
algebraic number. It was recently settled in the case of congruence subgroups
of the form $\Gamma_0(N)$ by analytic methods. In this paper we provide a
geometric and motivic interpretation of the general conjecture, and show that
it is a consequence of a standard conjecture in the theory of motives. In
addition, we define a new class of matrix-valued higher Green's functions for
both odd and even weight modular forms, and show that they are single-valued
periods of a motive constructed from a suitable moduli stack of elliptic curves
with marked points. The motive has the structure of a biextension involving
symmetric powers of the motives of elliptic curves. This suggests a very
general extension of the Gross-Zagier conjecture relating values of
matrix-valued higher Green's functions at points which do not necessarily have
complex multiplication to special values of $L$-functions. In particular, our
motivic interpretation of the Gross-Zagier log-algebraicity conjecture enables
us to give a completely geometric proof in level 1 and weight 4 by showing that
the motive of the moduli stack $\mathcal{M}_{1,3}$ of elliptic curves with 3
marked points is mixed Tate.
  In the course of this paper we develop many new foundational results on: the
theory of weak harmonic lifts, meromorphic modular forms, biextensions of
modular motives, and their corresponding algebraic de Rham cohomology and
single-valued periods, which may all be of independent interest.

Abstract: In the plane, three integer points ("fleas") are given. At every tick of
time, two of them (say, P,Q) instantly jump to two vacant points R,S, so that
PQRS is a square with that order of vertices. Description of all integers and
half-integers which occur as areas of spanned triangles turns out to be
unexpectedly intricate problem. For example, if one starts from a triple (0,0),
(2,0), (4,1), these positive integers are missed: 2*{0, 1, 4, 15, 16, 20, 79,
84, 95, 119, 156}, with no other up to 3*10^6 (and seemingly, none at all);
half-integers which are missed seem to form a 39-element set (the largest of
them being 11365/2). However, there exist certain starting setups which have an
"integrable" component as part of the answer. We demonstrate that for the
initial triple (0,0), (2,1), (3,2), the integers missed as areas are perfect
squares, and the the sporadic set {5, 29, 80, 99, 179} with no other elements
up to 3*10^6 (most likely, no other at all; all half-integers serve as areas).

$n$ divisible by $3$ such that the global root number of $E_{-432n^2}$ is $1$.
For example, for a prime $\ell \equiv 7 \pmod{9}$, we show that for $3\ell$ to
be a sum of two rational cubes, it is necessary that the ideal class group of
$\Q(\sqrt[3]{12\ell})$ contains $\frac{\Z}{6\Z}\oplus \frac{\Z}{3\Z}$ as a
subgroup. Moreover, for a positive proportion of primes $\ell \equiv 7
\pmod{9}$, $3\ell$ can not be a sum of two rational cubes. A key ingredient in
the proof is to explore the relation between the $2$-Selmer group and the
$3$-isogeny Selmer group of $E_{-432n^2}$ with the ideal class groups of
appropriate cubic number fields.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over a number field $k$. The
Green--Griffiths--Lang conjecture relates the question of finiteness of
rational points in $X$ to the triviality of rational maps from abelian
varieties to $X$ and to complex hyperbolicity. Here we investigate the
phenomenon of sparsity of rational points in $X$ -- roughly speaking, when
there are very few rational points if counted ordered by height. We are
interested in the case when sparsity holds over every finite extension of $k$,
in which case we say that the variety is \emph{xeric}. We initiate a systematic
study of the relation of this property with the non-existence of rational
curves in $X$ as well as with certain notion of $p$-adic hyperbolicity.

Abstract: This paper establishes an existence theory for discrete second-order boundary
value problems on non-uniform time grids using the upper and lower solution
method. We consider difference equations of the form $u^{\Delta\Delta}(t_{i-1})
+ f(t_i, u(t_i), u^\Delta(t_{i-1})) = 0$ on a non-uniform time grid ${t_0, t_1,
\ldots, t_{n+2}}$ with mixed boundary conditions $u^\Delta(t_0) = 0$ and
$u(t_{n+2}) = g(t_{n+2})$. This extends previous work on homogeneous boundary
conditions to the non-homogeneous case, requiring a sophisticated functional
analytic framework to handle the resulting affine function spaces. Our approach
employs a decomposition strategy that separates boundary effects from the
differential structure, enabling the application of Brouwer's Fixed Point
Theorem to establish existence with solutions bounded between upper and lower
functions.

Abstract: We generalize the framework of discrete algebraic dynamical systems
\cite{Andriamifidisoa2014} to Laurent polynomials and series over \(\Z^r\),
enabling the modeling of bidirectional discrete systems. By redefining the
spaces \(\Dprime\) and \(\Aprime\), introducing a bilinear mapping (defined as
the scalar product in Section 3), and extending the shift operator, we preserve
the duality and adjoint properties of \cite{Andriamifidisoa2014}. These
properties are rigorously proved and illustrated through examples and a data
processing case study on bidirectional sequence transformations. In contrast to
Oberst \cite{Ob90}, our algebraic approach emphasizes the structure of Laurent
series, providing a streamlined framework for multidimensional systems. This
work addresses an open question from \cite{Andriamifidisoa2014} and has
applications in multidimensional data processing, such as image filtering and
control theory.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we solve the semi-fuzzy linear system (SFLS)
$A \mathbf{\tilde{x}}= \mathbf{\tilde{b}}$, where $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$
is a real-valued matrix, $\mathbf{\tilde{b}}$ is a fuzzy number vector, and
$\mathbf{\tilde{x}}$ is the unknown fuzzy number vector. The elements of both
$\mathbf{\tilde{b}}$ and $\mathbf{\tilde{x}}$ belong to a fuzzy number space
$\mathcal{X}$, namely the Gaussian probability density membership function
(Gaussian-PDMF) space. We present the Cramer's rule to calculate the solution
with square matrix $A$ and find out that its solution set is a $5(n-R(A))$
dimensional affine space with $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and $R(A)$ being
the rank of $A$. The explicit form of the solution for RREF matrix $A$ is
stated to ensure usability for modeling. In the second part of the paper, we
solve the fully-fuzzy linear system (FFLS)
$\mathbf{\tilde{A}}\mathbf{\tilde{x}}=\mathbf{\tilde{b}}$, where
$\mathbf{\tilde{A}}$ is a fuzzy matrix with all components in $\mathcal{X}$. We
analyze its solution set and present the parametric form of solutions under the
fuzzy RREF matrix. We then adapt Gaussian elimination method to fuzzy matrices
and systems by restricting it to the unit group of ring $\mathcal{X}$, proving
the equivalence of solution sets after elementary row operations. We also
establish the connection between FFLS and SFLS by confining elements of
$\mathbf{\tilde{A}}$ to a subset of $\mathcal{X}$ that forms a field. In the
third part, two numerical examples are given to illustrated our method. All
results in this paper are explicit since the Gaussian-PDMF space $\mathcal{X}$,
to which the membership function of the fuzzy number belongs, possesses a
complete algebraic structure. The proposed framework offers a feasible and
systematical tool for solving the mathematical models using fuzzy linear
systems with uncertainty and fuzziness.

Abstract: A Steinhaus triangle modulo $m$ is a finite down-pointing triangle of
elements in the finite cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ satisfying the
same local rule as the standard Pascal triangle modulo $m$. A Steinhaus
triangle modulo $m$ is said to be balanced if it contains all the elements of
$\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ with the same multiplicity. In this paper, the
existence of infinitely many balanced Steinhaus triangles modulo $m$, for any
positive integer $m$, is shown. This is achieved by considering periodic
triangles generated from interlaced arithmetic progressions. This positively
answers a weak version of a problem, due to John C. Molluzzo in 1978, that has
remained unsolved to date for the even values of $m\geqslant 12$.

Abstract: We present a new algorithm for improving lower bounds on $ex(n;\{C_3,C_4\})$,
the maximum size (number of edges) of an $n$-vertex graph of girth at least 5.
The core of our algorithm is a variant of a hill-climbing heuristic introduced
by Exoo, McKay, Myrvold and Nadon (2011) to find small cages. Our algorithm
considers a range of values of $n$ in multiple passes. In each pass, the
hill-climbing heuristic for a specific value of $n$ is initialized with a few
graphs obtained by modifying near-extremal graphs previously found for
neighboring values of $n$, allowing to `propagate' good patterns that were
found. Focusing on the range $n\in \{74,75, \dots, 198\}$, which is currently
beyond the scope of exact methods, our approach yields improvements on existing
lower bounds for $ex(n;\{C_3,C_4\})$ for all $n$ in the range, except for two
values of $n$ ($n=96,97$).

alternate and present a recursion for any matroid. The classic characteristic
polynomials were motivated by the chromatic polynomial on graphs. We define a
generalized proper vertex coloring on a graph, which we call coupled
multicoloring. We also define a generalized nowhere zero flow, which we call
coupled multicommodity flow. Then we show that these chain characteristic
polynomials enumerate the number of coupled multicolorings and coupled
multicommodity flows on a graph. We conclude by listing multiple problems on
enumerative properties of chain characteristic polynomials.

Abstract: The classical spectral Tur\'{a}n problem is to determine the maximum spectral
radius of an $\mathcal{F}$-free graph of order $n$. Zhai and Wang [Linear
Algebra Appl, 437 (2012) 1641-1647] determined the maximum spectral radius of
${C}_{4}$-free graphs of given order. Additionally, Nikiforov obtained spectral
strengthenings of the K\H{o}vari-S\'{o}s-Tur\'{a}n theorem [Linear Algebra
Appl, 432 (2010) 1405-1411] when the forbidden graphs are complete bipartite.
The spectral Tur\'{a}n problem concerning forbidden complete bipartite graphs
in signed graphs has also attracted considerable attention. Let
$\mathcal{K}_{s,t}^-$ be the set of all unbalanced signed graphs with
underlying graphs $K_{s,t}$. Since the cases where $s=1$ or $t=1$ do not
conform to the definition of $\mathcal{K}_{s,t}^-$, it follows that $s,t\geq
2$. Wang and Lin [Discrete Appl. Math, 372 (2025) 164-172] have solved the case
of $s=t=2$ since $\mathcal{K}_{2,2}^-$ is $\mathcal{C}_{4}^{-}$ in this
situation. This paper gives an answer for $s=t=3$ and completely characterizes
the corresponding extremal signed graphs.

Abstract: For an ordered graph $F$, denote the Tur\'an density by $\vec{\pi}(F)$. The
relative Tur\'an density, denoted by $\rho(F)$, is the supremum over $\alpha
\in [0,1]$ such that every ordered graph $G$ contains an $F$-free subgraph $G'$
with $e(G') \geq \alpha e(G)$. Reiher, R\"odl, Sales and Schacht showed that
$\rho(P) = \vec{\pi}(P)/2$ and $\rho(K) = \vec{\pi}(K)$ for any ascending path
$P$ or clique $K$. They asked if there are any ordered graphs $F$ with
$\vec{\pi}(F)/2 < \rho(F) < \vec{\pi}(F)$. We answer this question in the
affirmative by describing a family of such $F$. We also determine the relative
Tur\'an densities of some small ordered matchings, showing that
$\rho\left(\{\{1,6\}, \{2,3\}, \{4,5\}\}\right)=0$ and $\rho\left(\{\{1,3\},
\{2,5\}, \{4,6\}\}\right)=0$.

Abstract: In 1989, Rota conjectured that, given any $n$ bases $B_1,\dots,B_n$ of a
vector space of dimension $n$, or more generally a matroid of rank $n$, it is
possible to rearrange these into $n$ disjoint transversal bases. Here, a
transversal basis is a basis consisting of exactly one element from each of the
original bases $B_1,\dots,B_n$. Two natural approaches to this conjecture are,
to ask in this setting a) how many disjoint transversal bases can we find and
b) how few transversal bases do we need to cover all the elements of
$B_1,\dots,B_n$? In this paper, we give asymptotically-tight answers to both of
these questions.
  For a), we show that there are always $(1-o(1))n$ disjoint transversal bases,
improving a result of Buci\'c, Kwan, Pokrovskiy, and Sudakov that $(1/2-o(1))n$
disjoint transversal bases always exist. For b), we show that $B_1\cup\dots
\cup B_n$ can be covered by $(1+o(1))n$ transversal bases, improving a result
of Aharoni and Berger using instead $2n$ transversal bases, and a subsequent
result of the Polymath project on Rota's basis conjecture using $2n-2$
transversal bases.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with
graph-structured data for tasks like node classification, a domain
traditionally dominated by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While this integration
leverages rich relational information to improve task performance, their
robustness against adversarial attacks remains unexplored. We take the first
step to explore the vulnerabilities of graph-aware LLMs by leveraging existing
adversarial attack methods tailored for graph-based models, including those for
poisoning (training-time attacks) and evasion (test-time attacks), on two
representative models, LLAGA (Chen et al. 2024) and GRAPHPROMPTER (Liu et al.
2024). Additionally, we discover a new attack surface for LLAGA where an
attacker can inject malicious nodes as placeholders into the node sequence
template to severely degrade its performance. Our systematic analysis reveals
that certain design choices in graph encoding can enhance attack success, with
specific findings that: (1) the node sequence template in LLAGA increases its
vulnerability; (2) the GNN encoder used in GRAPHPROMPTER demonstrates greater
robustness; and (3) both approaches remain susceptible to imperceptible feature
perturbation attacks. Finally, we propose an end-to-end defense framework
GALGUARD, that combines an LLM-based feature correction module to mitigate
feature-level perturbations and adapted GNN defenses to protect against
structural attacks.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: The semidirect discrete logarithm problem (SDLP) in finite groups was
proposed as a foundation for post-quantum cryptographic protocols, based on the
belief that its non-abelian structure would resist quantum attacks. However,
recent results have shown that SDLP in finite groups admits efficient quantum
algorithms, undermining its quantum resistance. This raises a fundamental
question: does the SDLP offer any computational advantages over the standard
discrete logarithm problem (DLP) against classical adversaries? In this work,
we investigate the classical hardness of SDLP across different finite group
platforms. We establish that the group-case SDLP can be reformulated as a
generalized discrete logarithm problem, enabling adaptation of classical
algorithms to study its complexity. We present a concrete adaptation of the
Baby-Step Giant-Step algorithm for SDLP, achieving time and space complexity
$O(\sqrt{r})$ where $r$ is the period of the underlying cycle structure.
Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation in SageMath, we
demonstrate that the classical hardness of SDLP is highly platform-dependent
and does not uniformly exceed that of standard DLP. In finite fields
$\mathbb{F}_p^*$, both problems exhibit comparable complexity. Surprisingly, in
elliptic curves $E(\mathbb{F}_p)$, the SDLP becomes trivial due to the bounded
automorphism group, while in elementary abelian groups $\mathbb{F}_p^n$, the
SDLP can be harder than DLP, with complexity varying based on the eigenvalue
structure of the automorphism. Our findings reveal that the non-abelian
structure of semidirect products does not inherently guarantee increased
classical hardness, suggesting that the search for classically hard problems
for cryptographic applications requires more careful consideration of the
underlying algebraic structures.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Timely and effective incident response is key to managing the growing
frequency of cyberattacks. However, identifying the right response actions for
complex systems is a major technical challenge. A promising approach to
mitigate this challenge is to use the security knowledge embedded in large
language models (LLMs) to assist security operators during incident handling.
Recent research has demonstrated the potential of this approach, but current
methods are mainly based on prompt engineering of frontier LLMs, which is
costly and prone to hallucinations. We address these limitations by presenting
a novel way to use an LLM for incident response planning with reduced
hallucination. Our method includes three steps: fine-tuning, information
retrieval, and lookahead planning. We prove that our method generates response
plans with a bounded probability of hallucination and that this probability can
be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased planning time under
certain assumptions. Moreover, we show that our method is lightweight and can
run on commodity hardware. We evaluate our method on logs from incidents
reported in the literature. The experimental results show that our method a)
achieves up to 22% shorter recovery times than frontier LLMs and b) generalizes
to a broad range of incident types and response actions.

Abstract: Mobile network operators implement firewalls to stop illicit messages, but
scammers find ways to evade detection. Previous work has looked into SMS texts
that are blocked by these firewalls. However, there is little insight into SMS
texts that bypass them and reach users. To this end, we collaborate with a
major mobile network operator to receive 1.35m user reports submitted over four
months. We find 89.16% of user reports comprise text messages, followed by
reports of suspicious calls and URLs. Using our methodological framework, we
identify 35.12% of the unique text messages reported by users as spam, while
40.27% are scam text messages. This is the first paper that investigates SMS
reports submitted by users and differentiates between spam and scams. Our paper
classifies the identified scam text messages into 12 scam types, of which the
most popular is 'wrong number' scams. We explore the various infrastructure
services that scammers abuse to conduct SMS scams, including mobile network
operators and hosting infrastructure, and analyze the text of the scam messages
to understand how scammers lure victims into providing them with their personal

Abstract: Visual cryptography schemes (VCSs) belong to a category of secret image
sharing schemes that do not require cryptographic knowledge for decryption,
instead relying directly on the human visual system. Among VCSs, random
grid-based VCS (RGVCS) has garnered widespread attention as it avoids pixel
expansion while requiring no basic matrices design. Contrast, a core metric for
RGVCS, directly determines the visual quality of recovered images, rendering
its optimization a critical research objective. However, existing $(k,n)$
RGVCSs still fail to attain theoretical upper bounds on contrast, highlighting
the urgent need for higher-contrast constructions. In this paper, we propose a
novel sharing paradigm for RGVCS that constructs $(k,n)$-threshold schemes from
arbitrary $(k,n')$-threshold schemes $(k \leq n'\leq n)$, termed
\emph{$n'$-grouped $(k,n)$ RGVCS}. This paradigm establishes hierarchical
contrast characteristics: participants within the same group achieve optimal
recovery quality, while inter-group recovery shows a hierarchical contrast. We
further introduce a new contrast calculation formula tailored to the new
paradigm. Then, we propose a contrast-enhanced $(k,n)$ RGVCS by setting $n'=
k$, achieving the highest contrast value documented in the existing literature.
Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of
our proposed scheme in terms of contrast.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) is commonly employed to safeguard graph analysis or
publishing. Distance, a critical factor in graph analysis, is typically handled
using curator DP, where a trusted curator holds the complete neighbor lists of
all vertices and answers queries privately. However, in many real-world
scenarios, such a curator may not be present, posing a significant challenge
for implementing differentially private distance queries under Local
Differential Privacy (LDP). This paper proposes two approaches to address this
challenge. The first approach generates a synthetic graph by randomizing
responses and applies bitwise operations to reduce noise interference. However,
like other synthetic graph methods, this approach suffers from low utility. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a second approach, the first LDP method
specifically designed for distance queries, which captures the global graph
structure by continuously aggregating local distance vectors from neighboring
vertices. This process enables the accurate updating of global distances. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive theoretical
analysis and experimental evaluations on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Redacting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from unstructured text is
critical for ensuring data privacy in regulated domains. While earlier
approaches have relied on rule-based systems and domain-specific Named Entity
Recognition (NER) models, these methods fail to generalize across formats and
contexts. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising
alternative, yet the effect of architectural and training choices on redaction
performance remains underexplored. LLMs have demonstrated strong performance in
tasks that require contextual language understanding, including the redaction
of PII in free-form text. Prior work suggests that with appropriate adaptation,
LLMs can become effective contextual privacy learners. However, the
consequences of architectural and training choices for PII Redaction remain
underexplored. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of LLMs as
privacy-preserving PII Redaction systems. We evaluate a range of LLM
architectures and training strategies for their effectiveness in PII Redaction.
Our analysis measures redaction performance, semantic preservation, and PII
leakage, and compares these outcomes against latency and computational cost.
The results provide practical guidance for configuring LLM-based redactors that
are accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware. To support reproducibility and
real-world deployment, we release PRvL, an open-source suite of fine-tuned
models, and evaluation tools for general-purpose PII Redaction. PRvL is built
entirely on open-source LLMs and supports multiple inference settings for
flexibility and compliance. It is designed to be easily customized for
different domains and fully operable within secure, self-managed environments.
This enables data owners to perform redactions without relying on third-party
services or exposing sensitive content beyond their own infrastructure.

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent
catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents
an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for
prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to
provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP
framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that
combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for
intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration
data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM
processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system
classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and
assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance
manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web
searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date
maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The
Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes
immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts
requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing
vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually
relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between
condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial
practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the
application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework
for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial
sectors.

Abstract: Adversarial board games, as a paradigmatic domain of strategic reasoning and
intelligence, have long served as both a popular competitive activity and a
benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Building on this
foundation, we propose an adversarial benchmarking framework to assess the
comprehensive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through board games
competition, compensating the limitation of data dependency of the mainstream
Question-and-Answer (Q&A) based benchmark method. We introduce Qi Town, a
specialized evaluation platform that supports 5 widely played games and
involves 20 LLM-driven players. The platform employs both the Elo rating system
and a novel Performance Loop Graph (PLG) to quantitatively evaluate the
technical capabilities of LLMs, while also capturing Positive Sentiment Score
(PSS) throughout gameplay to assess mental fitness. The evaluation is
structured as a round-robin tournament, enabling systematic comparison across
players. Experimental results indicate that, despite technical differences,
most LLMs remain optimistic about winning and losing, demonstrating greater
adaptability to high-stress adversarial environments than humans. On the other
hand, the complex relationship between cyclic wins and losses in PLGs exposes
the instability of LLMs' skill play during games, warranting further
explanation and exploration.

Abstract: Autonomous web-based geographical information systems (AWebGIS) aim to
perform geospatial operations from natural language input, providing intuitive,
intelligent, and hands-free interaction. However, most current solutions rely
on cloud-based large language models (LLMs), which require continuous internet
access and raise users' privacy and scalability issues due to centralized
server processing. This study compares three approaches to enabling AWebGIS:
(1) a fully-automated online method using cloud-based LLMs (e.g., Cohere); (2)
a semi-automated offline method using classical machine learning classifiers
such as support vector machine and random forest; and (3) a fully autonomous
offline (client-side) method based on a fine-tuned small language model (SLM),
specifically T5-small model, executed in the client's web browser. The third
approach, which leverages SLMs, achieved the highest accuracy among all
methods, with an exact matching accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of
0.99, and recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L
scores of 0.98. Crucially, this client-side computation strategy reduces the
load on backend servers by offloading processing to the user's device,
eliminating the need for server-based inference. These results highlight the
feasibility of browser-executable models for AWebGIS solutions.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), with policy-gradient
algorithms dominating the post-training stage because of their efficiency and
effectiveness. However, most existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model
reasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic,
non-ideal scenarios. We identify three representative non-ideal scenarios with
practical relevance: summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and
contextual filtering. We introduce a new research direction guided by
brain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect
inputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We
fine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM)
using RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their
performance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL
fine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance
declines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical
limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Although we propose a
scenario-specific remediation method, our results suggest current methods leave
these reasoning deficits largely unresolved. This work highlights that the
reasoning abilities of large models are often overstated and underscores the
importance of evaluating models under non-ideal scenarios. The code and data
will be released at XXXX.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, as it predicts the
binding interactions between small-molecule ligands and protein pockets.
However, current multi-task learning models for docking often show inferior
performance in ligand docking compared to protein pocket docking. This
disparity arises largely due to the distinct structural complexities of ligands
and proteins. To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic
framework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game
called the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand
player and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve
this game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which
alternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop,
the players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's
structural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple
iterations. In the inner loop, each player dynamically refines its predictions
by incorporating its own predicted ligand or pocket poses back into its model.
We theoretically show the convergence of LoopPlay, ensuring stable
optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10\% improvement in
predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art
methods. This highlights its potential to enhance the accuracy of molecular
docking in drug discovery.

Abstract: We explore the application of large language models (LLMs) to empower domain
experts in integrating large, heterogeneous, and noisy urban spatial datasets.
Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases,
requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require
collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this
study, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our
analysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial
relationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and
sidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they
struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational
geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when
provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning,
LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a
review-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting
erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss
practical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in
real-world contexts and outline future research directions, including
post-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data
formats. Our findings position LLMs as a promising and flexible alternative to
traditional rule-based heuristics, advancing the capabilities of adaptive
spatial data integration.

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating
artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within
high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action
spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on
offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both
paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition,
we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2
cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on
existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of
intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning
capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent
architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and
deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena
demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success
rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token
usage).

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved medical AI, enabling it to unify the understanding of
visual and textual information. However, as medical knowledge continues to
evolve, it is critical to allow these models to efficiently update outdated or
incorrect information without retraining from scratch. Although textual
knowledge editing has been widely studied, there is still a lack of systematic
benchmarks for multimodal medical knowledge editing involving image and text
modalities. To fill this gap, we present MedMKEB, the first comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the reliability, generality, locality,
portability, and robustness of knowledge editing in medical multimodal large
language models. MedMKEB is built on a high-quality medical visual
question-answering dataset and enriched with carefully constructed editing
tasks, including counterfactual correction, semantic generalization, knowledge
transfer, and adversarial robustness. We incorporate human expert validation to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the benchmark. Extensive single editing
and sequential editing experiments on state-of-the-art general and medical
MLLMs demonstrate the limitations of existing knowledge-based editing
approaches in medicine, highlighting the need to develop specialized editing
strategies. MedMKEB will serve as a standard benchmark to promote the
development of trustworthy and efficient medical knowledge editing algorithms.

Abstract: Analog circuit design is a time-consuming, experience-driven task in chip
development. Despite advances in AI, developing universal, fast, and stable
gate sizing methods for analog circuits remains a significant challenge. Recent
approaches combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic search
techniques to enhance generalizability, but they often depend on large model
sizes and lack portability across different technology nodes. To overcome these
limitations, we propose EasySize, the first lightweight gate sizing framework
based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability
across process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize
exploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to
dynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient
heuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow. Although finetuned
solely on 350nm node data, EasySize achieves strong performance on 5
operational amplifier (Op-Amp) netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm technology
nodes without additional targeted training, and outperforms AutoCkt, a
widely-used Reinforcement Learning based sizing framework, on 86.67\% of tasks
with more than 96.67\% of simulation resources reduction. We argue that
EasySize can significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise and
computational resources in gate sizing, thereby accelerating and simplifying
the analog circuit design process. EasySize will be open-sourced at a later
date.

Abstract: Generative AI is no longer a peripheral tool in higher education. It is
rapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how
knowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings
from a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language
model designed to scaffold student research question development through
structured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65
pre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with
the Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students
using the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical,
independent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate
metacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due
to generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a
broader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of
specialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of
orchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated
by educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated
roles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted
offer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from
these agents. Beyond technical feasibility, we examine system-level
implications for higher education institutions and students, including funding
necessities, changes to faculty roles, curriculars, competencies and assessment
practices. We conclude with a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis
highlighting the scalability of such systems. In sum, this study contributes
both empirical evidence and a conceptual roadmap for hybrid learning ecosystems
that embed human-AI co-agency and pedagogical alignment.

Abstract: The quality of event logs in Process Mining is crucial when applying any form
of analysis to them. In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be
non-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual
recording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and
often may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard
approaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the
availability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by
leveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep
Learning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In
recent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling
input data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph
Neural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks,
offer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex
multi-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for
more expressive and semantically rich encodings.
  In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Network model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will
return the full set of attributes missing from those events. We evaluate our
work against a state-of-the-art approach leveraging autoencoders on two
synthetic logs and four real event logs, on different types of missing values.
Different from state-of-the-art model-free approaches, which mainly focus on
repairing a subset of event attributes, the proposed approach shows very good
performance in reconstructing all different event attributes.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate
hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely
adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA).
However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in
isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require
multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this
limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for
Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to
identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a
search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By
orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system
supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle
complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM
Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves
substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores,
outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the
multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic
reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that
loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees
and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system.
Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while
LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive
planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and
mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning
over both structured and unstructured inputs.
  The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On
\textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through
logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in
multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it
boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles.
Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the
system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual
inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust,
interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic

Abstract: The term 'agent' in artificial intelligence has long carried multiple
interpretations across different subfields. Recent developments in AI
capabilities, particularly in large language model systems, have amplified this
ambiguity, creating significant challenges in research communication, system
evaluation and reproducibility, and policy development. This paper argues that
the term 'agent' requires redefinition. Drawing from historical analysis and
contemporary usage patterns, we propose a framework that defines clear minimum
requirements for a system to be considered an agent while characterizing
systems along a multidimensional spectrum of environmental interaction,
learning and adaptation, autonomy, goal complexity, and temporal coherence.
This approach provides precise vocabulary for system description while
preserving the term's historically multifaceted nature. After examining
potential counterarguments and implementation challenges, we provide specific
recommendations for moving forward as a field, including suggestions for
terminology standardization and framework adoption. The proposed approach
offers practical tools for improving research clarity and reproducibility while
supporting more effective policy development.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their
capabilities from basic text processing to complex reasoning tasks, including
legal interpretation, argumentation, and strategic interaction. However,
empirical understanding of LLM behavior in open-ended, multi-agent settings
especially those involving deliberation over legal and ethical dilemmas remains
limited. We introduce NomicLaw, a structured multi-agent simulation where LLMs
engage in collaborative law-making, responding to complex legal vignettes by
proposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals. We
quantitatively measure trust and reciprocity via voting patterns and
qualitatively assess how agents use strategic language to justify proposals and
influence outcomes. Experiments involving homogeneous and heterogeneous LLM
groups demonstrate how agents spontaneously form alliances, betray trust, and
adapt their rhetoric to shape collective decisions. Our results highlight the
latent social reasoning and persuasive capabilities of ten open-source LLMs and
provide insights into the design of future AI systems capable of autonomous
negotiation, coordination and drafting legislation in legal settings.

Abstract: Reasoning with minimal models has always been at the core of many knowledge
representation techniques, but we still have only a limited understanding of
this problem in Description Logics (DLs). Minimization of some selected
predicates, letting the remaining predicates vary or be fixed, as proposed in
circumscription, has been explored and exhibits high complexity. The case of
`pure' minimal models, where the extension of all predicates must be minimal,
has remained largely uncharted. We address this problem in popular DLs and
obtain surprisingly negative results: concept satisfiability in minimal models
is undecidable already for $\mathcal{EL}$. This undecidability also extends to
a very restricted fragment of tuple-generating dependencies. To regain
decidability, we impose acyclicity conditions on the TBox that bring the
worst-case complexity below double exponential time and allow us to establish a
connection with the recently studied pointwise circumscription; we also derive
results in data complexity. We conclude with a brief excursion to the DL-Lite
family, where a positive result was known for DL-Lite$_{\text{core}}$, but our
investigation establishes ExpSpace-hardness already for its extension
DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$.

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Models often struggle with complex, multi-question
reasoning tasks where partial correctness is crucial for effective learning.
Traditional reward mechanisms, which provide a single binary score for an
entire response, are too coarse to guide models through intricate problems with
multiple sub-parts. To address this, we introduce StructVRM, a method that
aligns multimodal reasoning with Structured and Verifiable Reward Models. At
its core is a model-based verifier trained to provide fine-grained,
sub-question-level feedback, assessing semantic and mathematical equivalence
rather than relying on rigid string matching. This allows for nuanced, partial
credit scoring in previously intractable problem formats. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of StructVRM. Our trained model, Seed-StructVRM,
achieves state-of-the-art performance on six out of twelve public multimodal
benchmarks and our newly curated, high-difficulty STEM-Bench. The success of
StructVRM validates that training with structured, verifiable rewards is a
highly effective approach for advancing the capabilities of multimodal models
in complex, real-world reasoning domains.

Abstract: This work contributes to a real-time data-driven predictive maintenance
solution for Intelligent Transportation Systems. The proposed method implements
a processing pipeline comprised of sample pre-processing, incremental
classification with Machine Learning models, and outcome explanation. This
novel online processing pipeline has two main highlights: (i) a dedicated
sample pre-processing module, which builds statistical and frequency-related
features on the fly, and (ii) an explainability module. This work is the first
to perform online fault prediction with natural language and visual
explainability. The experiments were performed with the MetroPT data set from
the metro operator of Porto, Portugal. The results are above 98 % for F-measure
and 99 % for accuracy. In the context of railway predictive maintenance,
achieving these high values is crucial due to the practical and operational
implications of accurate failure prediction. In the specific case of a high
F-measure, this ensures that the system maintains an optimal balance between
detecting the highest possible number of real faults and minimizing false
alarms, which is crucial for maximizing service availability. Furthermore, the
accuracy obtained enables reliability, directly impacting cost reduction and
increased safety. The analysis demonstrates that the pipeline maintains high
performance even in the presence of class imbalance and noise, and its
explanations effectively reflect the decision-making process. These findings
validate the methodological soundness of the approach and confirm its practical
applicability for supporting proactive maintenance decisions in real-world
railway operations. Therefore, by identifying the early signs of failure, this
pipeline enables decision-makers to understand the underlying problems and act
accordingly swiftly.

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual abilities
and impressive visual reasoning, they struggle with attention to detail and
precise action planning in complex, dynamic environments, leading to subpar
performance. Real-world tasks typically require complex interactions, advanced
spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous strategy refinement,
usually necessitating understanding the physics rules of the target scenario.
However, evaluating these capabilities in real-world scenarios is often
prohibitively expensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepPHY, a novel
benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate VLMs' understanding and
reasoning about fundamental physical principles through a series of challenging
simulated environments. DeepPHY integrates multiple physical reasoning
environments of varying difficulty levels and incorporates fine-grained
evaluation metrics. Our evaluation finds that even state-of-the-art VLMs
struggle to translate descriptive physical knowledge into precise, predictive
control.

speculative tools into practical lab partners. We show how coupling LLMs with
graph neural networks, quantum calculations and real-time spectroscopy shrinks
discovery cycles and supports greener, data-driven chemistry. We discuss
limitations, including biased datasets, opaque reasoning and the need for
safety gates that prevent unintentional hazards. Finally, we outline community

aim to democratize access while keeping humans firmly in control. These
advances chart a path towards rapid, reliable and inclusive molecular

Abstract: AI (super) alignment describes the challenge of ensuring (future) AI systems
behave in accordance with societal norms and goals. While a quickly evolving
literature is addressing biases and inequalities, the geographic variability of
alignment remains underexplored. Simply put, what is considered appropriate,
truthful, or legal can differ widely across regions due to cultural norms,
political realities, and legislation. Alignment measures applied to AI/ML
workflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical
realities, such as text-to-image models depicting balanced gender ratios in
company leadership despite existing imbalances. Crucially, some model outputs
are globally acceptable, while others, e.g., questions about Kashmir, depend on
knowing the user's location and their context. This geographic sensitivity is
not new. For instance, Google Maps renders Kashmir's borders differently based
on user location. What is new is the unprecedented scale and automation with
which AI now mediates knowledge, expresses opinions, and represents geographic
reality to millions of users worldwide, often with little transparency about
how context is managed. As we approach Agentic AI, the need for
spatio-temporally aware alignment, rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, is
increasingly urgent. This paper reviews key geographic research problems,
suggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment
sensitivity.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust
evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act
and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices
depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to
measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape.
This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this "benchmark-regulation
gap." We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses
validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from
widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities
and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation
ecosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities,
such as "Tendency to hallucinate" (53.7% of the corpus) and "Discriminatory
bias" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously
neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios,
including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI
development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This
translates to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks like "Loss of
Control" (0.4% coverage) and "Cyber Offence" (0.8% coverage). This study
provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, offering
critical insights for policymakers to refine the CoP and for developers to
build the next generation of evaluation tools, ultimately fostering safer and
more compliant AI.

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) focuses on identifying emotion
shifts within interactions, representing a significant step toward advancing
machine intelligence. However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets
face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent
subjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically
expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data
generation--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small,
resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with
diverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We
generate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We
evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for
ERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC. Our
experimental results indicate that ERC classifier models trained on the
generated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve
statistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive reasoning abilities on
a wide range of complex tasks. However, enhancing these capabilities through
post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and
computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample
efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on
heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we
introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework
that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of
InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates
high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using
multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance
gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to
new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model
achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only
approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization
across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through
the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical
reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME
24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining
principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical
solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient
manner. The model checkpoints are available at

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) techniques have exhibited remarkable performance across a wide range of
domains. However, existing RAG approaches primarily operate on unstructured
data and demonstrate limited capability in handling structured knowledge such
as knowledge graphs. Meanwhile, current graph retrieval methods fundamentally
struggle to capture holistic graph structures while simultaneously facing
precision control challenges that manifest as either critical information gaps
or excessive redundant connections, collectively undermining reasoning
performance. To address this challenge, we propose GRAIL: Graph-Retrieval
Augmented Interactive Learning, a framework designed to interact with
large-scale graphs for retrieval-augmented reasoning. Specifically, GRAIL
integrates LLM-guided random exploration with path filtering to establish a
data synthesis pipeline, where a fine-grained reasoning trajectory is
automatically generated for each task. Based on the synthesized data, we then
employ a two-stage training process to learn a policy that dynamically decides
the optimal actions at each reasoning step. The overall objective of
precision-conciseness balance in graph retrieval is decoupled into fine-grained
process-supervised rewards to enhance data efficiency and training stability.
In practical deployment, GRAIL adopts an interactive retrieval paradigm,
enabling the model to autonomously explore graph paths while dynamically
balancing retrieval breadth and precision. Extensive experiments have shown
that GRAIL achieves an average accuracy improvement of 21.01% and F1
improvement of 22.43% on three knowledge graph question-answering datasets. Our
source code and datasets is available at https://github.com/Changgeww/GRAIL.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of foundation models as agents across diverse domains
necessitates a robust evaluation framework. Current methods, such as
LLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step
reasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing
Agent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,
are typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this
gap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task
completion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like
evaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using
available information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module
contributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs
are aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our
framework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA
and BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement
to human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy,
respectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. This
demonstrates the potential of our proposed general-purpose evaluation
framework.

Abstract: Social media has evolved into a complex multimodal environment where text,
images, and other signals interact to shape nuanced meanings, often concealing
harmful intent. Identifying such intent, whether sarcasm, hate speech, or
misinformation, remains challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, rapid
cultural shifts, and subtle pragmatic cues. To address these challenges, we
propose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection
gating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles
four complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a
modality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse
interpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents
refine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and
efficiency. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MV-Debate
significantly outperforms strong single-model and existing multi-agent debate
baselines. This work highlights the promise of multi-agent debate in advancing
reliable social intent detection in safety-critical online contexts.

Abstract: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation
for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without
continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust
high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for
reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges
that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The
proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated
data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on
extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the
bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we
identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI
systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to
changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing
external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,
allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a
unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative
world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create
agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with
human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that
can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical
constraints.

Abstract: Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a
major research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent
approaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore
cognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track
progress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we
introduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language
Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore
human-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically
grounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free
General Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly
knowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer
interaction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners
over a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis
reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our
specially designed "trap questions" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's
shallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct
learners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'
self-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing
surprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)
Critically, the default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface
Learner"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,
generalizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that
LearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings
about LLMs' behavior.

Conclusion: Error processing this paper.

Abstract: The aircraft routing problem is one of the most studied problems of
operations research applied to aircraft management. It involves assigning
flights to aircraft while ensuring regular visits to maintenance bases. This
paper examines two aspects of the problem.
  First, we explore the relationship between periodic instances, where flights
are the same every day, and periodic solutions. The literature has implicitly
assumed-without discussion-that periodic instances necessitate periodic
solutions, and even periodic solutions in a stronger form, where every two
airplanes perform either the exact same cyclic sequence of flights, or
completely disjoint cyclic sequences. However, enforcing such periodicity may
eliminate feasible solutions. We prove that, when regular maintenance is
required at most every four days, there always exist periodic solutions of this
form.
  Second, we consider the computational hardness of the problem. Even if many
papers in this area refer to the NP-hardness of the aircraft routing problem,
such a result is only available in the literature for periodic instances. We
establish its NP-hardness for a non-periodic version. Polynomiality of a
special but natural case is also proven.
