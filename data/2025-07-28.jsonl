The restriction on $F$ allowed them, among\nother things, to reduce the case of irreducible polynomials of the form\n$x^3-a$.

Human cognition achieves this flexibility via the interplay of the\nhippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC): the hippocampus rapidly encodes\nepisodes, and the prefrontal cortex consolidates them into reusable schemas for\nreasoning. Drawing on these insights, we present MIRAGE (Meta-Inference with\nRules and Abstractions from Generalized Experience), a framework that achieves\nsystematic generalization on compositional tasks. MIRAGE has two interacting\nmodules mirroring the brain's deliberative HPC-PFC loop and intuitive\nneocortical pattern recognition. (1) The meta-trained Transformer Neural\nDecomposer, paralleling neocortical \"System 1\" computation, is trained on a\ntask-agnostic stream of randomly sampled compositional grammars and applies one\ndecomposition step per pass, with successive passes iteratively refining the\nsequence representation. (2) The Schema Engine, analogous to the HPC-PFC\n\"System 2\" loop, dynamically extracts, ranks, and applies reusable schemas,\nstoring variable bindings in episodic memory and expanding them when needed. By\nexplicitly equipping the Transformer component of MIRAGE with actively managed\nschematic structures, our model performs systematic compositional operations\nthrough explicit schema application and transformation, relying solely on\nfrozen weights when solving entirely novel tasks.

We generalise this fact to all directed\n$d$-regular graphs on $n$ vertices by showing that, on average, a random\ncycle-factor of such a graph has $\\mathcal{O}((n\\log d)/d)$ cycles. This is\ntight up to the constant factor and improves the best previous bound of the\nform $\\mathcal{O}(n/\\sqrt{\\log d})$ due to Vishnoi. Our results also yield\nrandomised polynomial-time algorithms for finding such a cycle-factor and for\nfinding a tour of length $(1+\\mathcal{O}((\\log d)/d)) \\cdot n$ if the graph is\nconnected. This makes progress on a conjecture of Magnant and Martin and on a\nproblem studied by Vishnoi and by Feige, Ravi, and Singh. Our proof uses the\nlanguage of entropy to exploit the fact that the upper and lower bounds on the\nnumber of perfect matchings in regular bipartite graphs are extremely close."}

The first part reviews recent\nfindings on the ability of LLMs to replicate key aspects of human cognition,\nincluding Theory of Mind reasoning and social inference, while also\nhighlighting significant limitations such as cognitive biases, lack of true\nunderstanding, and inconsistencies in behavior. The second part surveys\nemerging applications of LLMs in multi-agent simulation frameworks, focusing on\nsystem architectures, scale, and validation strategies. Notable projects such\nas Generative Agents (Smallville) and AgentSociety are discussed in terms of\ntheir design choices, empirical grounding, and methodological innovations.\nParticular attention is given to the challenges of behavioral fidelity,\ncalibration, and reproducibility in large-scale LLM-driven simulations. The\nfinal section distinguishes between contexts where LLMs, like other black-box\nsystems, offer direct value-such as interactive simulations and serious\ngames-and those where their use is more problematic, notably in explanatory or\npredictive modeling. The paper concludes by advocating for hybrid approaches\nthat integrate LLMs into traditional agent-based modeling platforms (GAMA,\nNetlogo, etc), enabling modelers to combine the expressive flexibility of\nlanguage-based reasoning with the transparency and analytical rigor of\nclassical rule-based systems."}

As a\nresult of algorithmic-inspired design and key architectural elements, both\nmodels can generalize to out-of-distribution instances, with FastNRS offering\nsignificant improvements in terms of memory efficiency, training speed, and\ninference time. We evaluate both architectures on four tasks involving the\nsimplification of mathematical formulas and further demonstrate their\nversatility in a multi-domain learning scenario, where a single model is\ntrained to solve multiple types of problems simultaneously. The proposed system\nsignificantly outperforms two strong neural baselines: the Neural Data Router,\na recent transformer variant specifically designed to solve algorithmic\nproblems, and GPT-4o, one of the most powerful general-purpose large-language\nmodels.

A Simple Benchmark for LLM Code Interpreter Security", "comment": null, "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate native code\ninterpreters, they enable powerful real-time execution capabilities,\nsubstantially expanding their utility. However, such integrations introduce\npotential system-level cybersecurity threats, fundamentally different from\nprompt-based vulnerabilities. To systematically evaluate these\ninterpreter-specific risks, we propose CIRCLE (Code-Interpreter Resilience\nCheck for LLM Exploits), a simple benchmark comprising 1,260 prompts targeting\nCPU, memory, and disk resource exhaustion. Each risk category includes\nexplicitly malicious (\"direct\") and plausibly benign (\"indirect\") prompt\nvariants. Our automated evaluation framework assesses not only whether LLMs\nrefuse or generates risky code, but also executes the generated code within the\ninterpreter environment to evaluate code correctness, simplifications made by\nthe LLM to make the code safe, or execution timeouts. Evaluating 7 commercially\navailable models from OpenAI and Google, we uncover significant and\ninconsistent vulnerabilities. For instance, evaluations show substantial\ndisparities even within providers - OpenAI's o4-mini correctly refuses risky\nrequests at 7.1%, notably higher rates compared to GPT-4.1 at 0.5%. Results\nparticularly underscore that indirect, socially-engineered prompts\nsubstantially weaken model defenses. This highlights an urgent need for\ninterpreter-specific cybersecurity benchmarks, dedicated mitigation tools\n(e.g., guardrails), and clear industry standards to guide safe and responsible\ndeployment of LLM interpreter integrations. The benchmark dataset and\nevaluation code are publicly released to foster further research."}
