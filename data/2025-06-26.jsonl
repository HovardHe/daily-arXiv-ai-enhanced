In classical network design problems, the objective is\nto minimize the cost of routing the demand flow through a graph. In this paper,\nwe introduce a generalized version of such a problem, where the objective is to\ntradeoff routing costs and delivery speed; we introduce the concept of\nspeed-coverage, which is defined as the number of unique items that can be sent\nto destinations in less than 1-day. Speed-coverage is a function of both the\nnetwork design and the inventory stored at origin nodes, e.g., an item can be\ndelivered in 1-day if it is in-stock at an origin that can reach a destination\nwithin 24 hours. Modeling inventory is inherently complex, since inventory\ncoverage is described by an integer function with a large number of points\n(exponential to the number of origin sites), each one to be evaluated using\nhistorical data. To bypass this complexity, we first leverage a parametric\noptimization approach, which converts the non-linear joint routing and\nspeed-coverage optimization problem into an equivalent mixed-integer linear\nprogram. Then, we propose a sampling strategy to avoid evaluating all the\npoints of the speed-coverage function.

In\nsuch attacks, adversaries can restore or even reconstruct input data by\nanalyzing and processing model outputs, owing to the neural network-based\nnature of the systems. In addition, traditional systems use image quality\nindicators (such as PSNR or SSIM) to assess attack severity, which may be\ninadequate for task-oriented semantic communication, since visual differences\ndo not necessarily ensure semantic divergence.

In this work we provide a high-dimensional statistical analysis for\nsymmetric low-rank matrix sensing observed under Gaussian measurements and\nnoise. Our main result describes a novel phenomenon: in this statistical model\nand in an appropriate asymptotic regime, the behavior of any local minimum of\nthe nonconvex factorized approach (with known rank) is approximately equivalent\nto that of the matrix hard-thresholding of a corresponding matrix denoising\nproblem, and the behavior of the convex nuclear-norm regularized least squares\napproach is approximately equivalent to that of matrix soft-thresholding of the\nsame matrix denoising problem. Here \"approximately equivalent\" is understood in\nthe sense of concentration of Lipchitz functions. As a consequence, the\nnonconvex procedure uniformly dominates the convex approach in mean squared\nerror. Our arguments are based on a matrix operator generalization of the\nConvex Gaussian Min-Max Theorem (CGMT) together with studying the interplay\nbetween local minima of the convex and nonconvex formulations and their\n\"debiased\" counterparts, and several of these results may be of independent\ninterest."}

This paper introduces the ARC\nframework, a method for achieving analytical resilience through an autonomous,\nclosed-loop hardening process. ARC establishes a perpetual co-evolutionary arms\nrace within the high-fidelity sandbox of a F-SCDT. A DRL agent, the \"Red\nAgent,\" is formalized and incentivized to autonomously discover stealthy,\nphysically-plausible attack paths that maximize process disruption while\nevading detection.

This co-evolutionary dynamic forces both agents to\nbecome progressively more sophisticated, enabling the system to autonomously\nprobe and patch its own vulnerabilities. Experimental validation on both the\nTEP and the SWaT testbeds demonstrates the framework's superior performance. A\ncomprehensive ablation study, supported by extensive visualizations including\nROC curves and SHAP plots, reveals that the co-evolutionary process itself is\nresponsible for a significant performance increase in detecting novel attacks.\nBy integrating XAI to ensure operator trust and proposing a scalable F-ARC\narchitecture, this work presents ARC not merely as an improvement, but as a\nnecessary paradigm shift toward dynamic, self-improving security for the future\nof critical infrastructure."}

In this study, we present a proof-of-concept multi-agent\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) framework designed to support sustainable protein\nproduction research, with an initial focus on microbial protein sources. Our\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-oriented system consists of two GPT-based\nLLM agents: (1) a literature search agent that retrieves relevant scientific\nliterature on microbial protein production for a specified microbial strain,\nand (2) an information extraction agent that processes the retrieved content to\nextract relevant biological and chemical information. Two parallel\nmethodologies, fine-tuning and prompt engineering, were explored for agent\noptimisation. Both methods demonstrated effectiveness at improving the\nperformance of the information extraction agent in terms of transformer-based\ncosine similarity scores between obtained and ideal outputs. Mean cosine\nsimilarity scores were increased by up to 25%, while universally reaching mean\nscores of $\\geq 0.89$ against ideal output text. Fine-tuning overall improved\nthe mean scores to a greater extent (consistently of $\\geq 0.94$) compared to\nprompt engineering, although lower statistical uncertainties were observed with\nthe latter approach.
