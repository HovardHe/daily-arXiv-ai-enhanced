Furthermore, we explicitly compute this operad in terms of generators\nand relations, showing that the M\\\"obius transform map induces a canonical\nisomorphism between the operad of cooperative games and the operad that encodes\ncommutative triassociative algebras. In other words, we prove that any\ncooperative game is a linear combination of iterated compositions of the\n2-player bargaining game and the 2-player dictator games. We show that many\ninteresting classes of games (simple, balanced, capacities a.k.a fuzzy measures\nand convex functions, totally monotone, etc) are stable under compositions, and\nthus form suboperads. In the convex case, this gives by the submodularity\ntheorem a new operad structure on the family of all generalized permutahedra.\nFinally, we focus on how solution concepts in cooperative game theory behave\nunder composition: we study the core of a composite and describe it in terms of\nthe core of its components, and we give explicit formulas for the Shapley value\nand the Banzhaf index of a compound game."}

This method is a hybrid\nof non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches for dimensionality\nreduction. It is a greedy method, which works by backward elimination,\neliminating possibly multiple features at every step. The rules contribute to\nvoting for features, and a decision to keep or discard is made by majority\nvoting. The rules make use of correlation thresholds between every pair of\nfeatures, and between features and the target. We provide the results from the\napplication of HCVR to the SPAMBASE dataset.

Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these\nAI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and\nimportant topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within\nmachine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to\nresample the training data to offset disparities.

While simple and\nseemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using\ndata obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label\nbias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and\nmedicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,\nemails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,\ndoctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support\nrigorous estimates of discrimination.

We introduce a convex hull approximation model for\nnonconvex LDES electrochemical dynamics, facilitating computational\ntractability and accuracy. To address temporal coupling in SoC dynamics and\nlong-term contracts, we generate hindsight-optimal state-of-charge (SoC)\ntrajectories of LDES and netloads for offline training. In the online stage, we\nemploy kernel regression to dynamically update the SoC reference and propose an\nadaptive online convex optimization (OCO) algorithm with SoC reference tracking\nand expert tracking to mitigate myopia and enable adaptive step-size\noptimization. We rigorously prove that both long-term and short-term policies\nachieve sublinear regret bounds over time, which improves with more regression\nscenarios, stronger tracking penalties, and finer convex approximations.\nSimulation results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods, reducing costs by 73.4%, eliminating load loss via reference tracking,\nand achieving an additional 2.4% cost saving via the OCO algorithm. These\nbenefits scale up with longer LDES durations, and the method demonstrates\nresilience to poor forecasts and unexpected system faults."}

Currently, there is no comprehensive study into the potential\nsecurity risk within these agent apps and their broader implications.\n  In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth and systematic security study of\nLLM email agents. We propose the Email Agent Hijacking (EAH) attack, which\noverrides the original prompts of the email agent via external email resources,\nallowing attackers to gain control of the email agent remotely and further\nperform specific attack scenarios without user awareness.\n  To facilitate the large-scale evaluation, we propose EAHawk, a pipeline to\nevaluate the EAH attack of LLM email agent apps. By EAHawk, we performed an\nempirical study spanning 14 representative LLM agent frameworks, 63 agent apps,\n12 LLMs, and 20 email services, which led to the generation of 1,404 real-world\nemail agent instances for evaluation. Experimental results indicate that all\n1,404 instances were successfully hijacked; on average, only 2.03 attack\nattempts are required to control an email agent instance. Even worse, for some\nLLMs, the average number of attempts needed to achieve full agent control drops\nto as few as 1.23."}

To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR\nalgorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the\nsolution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from\nstronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our\nproposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,\nand simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of\nsteps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration\ntoward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for\nindependent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss\nreward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the\nexternal reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,\nenabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration\nstagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across\nsix mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization\nand excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks."}

While recent years\nhave seen a proliferation of architectural, cryptographic, and economic\nstrategies to mitigate this issue, no one has yet fully resolved the\nfundamental question of how a blockchain can gain knowledge about the off-chain\nworld. In this position paper, we critically assess the role artificial\nintelligence (AI) can play in tackling the oracle problem.

We\nobserve that while AI introduces powerful tools for improving data quality,\nsource selection, and system resilience, it cannot eliminate the reliance on\nunverifiable off-chain inputs. Therefore, this study supports the idea that AI\nshould be understood as a complementary layer of inference and filtering within\na broader oracle design, not a substitute for trust assumptions."}

We focus on two types of steganography:\npassing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current\nmodels are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor\nnoticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given\nadditional affordances such as using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating\non what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models\ncan perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This\nincludes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes,\nincluding encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal.
