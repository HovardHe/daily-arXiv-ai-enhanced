Attempts to extend Scarf's celebrated distribution-free ordering\nrule using risk measures have led to conflicting prescriptions: CVaR-based\nmodels invariably recommend ordering less as risk aversion increases, while\nmean-standard deviation models -- paradoxically -- suggest ordering more,\nparticularly when ordering costs are high. We resolve this behavioral paradox\nthrough a coherent generalization of Scarf's distribution-free framework,\nmodeling risk aversion via distortion functionals from dual utility theory.\nDespite the generality of this class, we derive closed-form optimal ordering\nrules for any coherent risk preference. These rules uncover a consistent\nbehavioral principle: a more risk-averse newsvendor may rationally order more\nwhen overstocking is inexpensive (i.e., when the cost-to-price ratio is low),\nbut will always order less when ordering is costly. Our framework offers a more\nnuanced, managerially intuitive, and behaviorally coherent understanding of\nrisk-averse inventory decisions. It exposes the limitations of non-coherent\nmodels, delivers interpretable and easy-to-compute ordering rules grounded in\ncoherent preferences, and unifies prior work under a single, tractable\napproach.

During\ninference, the model maintains high accuracy on benign samples but\nmisclassifies poisoned samples into an attacker-specified target class.\nExisting research on backdoor attacks has explored developing triggers in the\nspatial, spectral (frequency), and semantic (feature) domains, aiming to make\nthem stealthy. While some approaches have considered designing triggers that\nare imperceptible in both spatial and spectral domains, few have incorporated\nthe semantic domain. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack, termed\n3S-attack, which is stealthy across the spatial, spectral, and semantic\ndomains. The key idea is to exploit the semantic features of benign samples as\ntriggers, using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and a\npreliminary model for extraction. The trigger is then embedded in the spectral\ndomain, followed by pixel-level restrictions after converting the samples back\nto the spatial domain. This process minimizes the distance between poisoned and\nbenign samples, making the attack harder to detect by existing defenses and\nhuman inspection. Extensive experiments on various datasets, along with\ntheoretical analysis, demonstrate the stealthiness of 3S-attack and highlight\nthe need for stronger defenses to ensure AI security.

This has sparked\nsignificant investment and interest, particularly in building data centers with\nthe necessary hardware and software to develop and operate AI models and\nAI-based workflows. In this technical review article, we present energy\nconsumption scenarios of data centers and impact on GHG emissions, considering\nboth near-term projections (up to 2030) and long-term outlook (2035 and\nbeyond). We address the quintessential question of whether AI will have a net\npositive, neutral, or negative impact on CO2 emissions by 2035. Additionally,\nwe discuss AI's potential to automate, create efficient and disruptive\nworkflows across various fields related to energy production, supply and\nconsumption. In the near-term scenario, the growing demand for AI will likely\nstrain computing resources, lead to increase in electricity consumption and\ntherefore associated CO2 emissions. This is due to the power-hungry nature of\nbig data centers and the requirements for training and running of large and\ncomplex AI models, as well as the penetration of AI assistant search and\napplications for public use. However, the long-term outlook could be more\npromising. AI has the potential to be a game-changer in CO2 reduction.

Furthermore, using\nREAL-IoT, we explore the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze\nnetwork data and mitigate the impact of adversarial examples by filtering\nsuspicious flows. Our evaluations using REAL-IoT reveal performance drops in\nGNN models compared to results from standard benchmarks, quantifying their\nsusceptibility to drift and realistic attacks.

However, this one-size-fits-all approach performs poorly\nfor individuals with irregular routines, often scheduling decision points after\nthe target behavior has already occurred, rendering interventions ineffective.\nIn this paper, we propose SigmaScheduling, a method to dynamically schedule\ndecision points based on uncertainty in predicted behavior times. When behavior\ntiming is more predictable, SigmaScheduling schedules decision points closer to\nthe predicted behavior time; when timing is less certain, SigmaScheduling\nschedules decision points earlier, increasing the likelihood of timely\nintervention.

While enabling\npowerful new capabilities, these systems also introduce unique forms of\nuncertainty stemming from probabilistic reasoning, evolving memory states, and\nfluid execution paths. Traditional software observability and operations\npractices fall short in addressing these challenges.\n  This paper introduces AgentOps: a comprehensive framework for observing,\nanalyzing, optimizing, and automating operation of agentic AI systems. We\nidentify distinct needs across four key roles-developers, testers, site\nreliability engineers (SREs), and business users-each of whom engages with the\nsystem at different points in its lifecycle. We present the AgentOps Automation\nPipeline, a six-stage process encompassing behavior observation, metric\ncollection, issue detection, root cause analysis, optimized recommendations,\nand runtime automation. Throughout, we emphasize the critical role of\nautomation in managing uncertainty and enabling self-improving AI systems-not\nby eliminating uncertainty, but by taming it to ensure safe, adaptive, and\neffective operation."}

We propose an intermediate Intention Capture layer between user\nqueries and Workflow Generation, implementing the Opus Workflow Intention\nFramework, which consists of extracting Workflow Signals from user queries,\ninterpreting them into structured Workflow Intention objects, and generating\nWorkflows based on these Intentions. Our results show that this layer enables\nLLMs to produce logical and meaningful outputs that scale reliably as query\ncomplexity increases. On a synthetic benchmark of 1,000 multi-intent\nquery-Workflow(s) pairs, applying the Opus Prompt Intention Framework to\nWorkflow Generation yields consistent improvements in semantic Workflow\nsimilarity metrics. In this paper, we introduce the Opus Prompt Intention\nFramework by applying the concepts of Workflow Signal and Workflow Intention to\nLLM-driven Workflow Generation.

To\nmake our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first\nestablish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains\nover an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational\nprocesses. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary\ninsights to enrich the \"adaptation-rather-than-search\" view of learning.
