This technique of ``decoupling via affine spectral-independence''\nis quite general and may be of independent interest."}

In this\npaper, we present \\textbf{RecAgent}, an uncertainty-aware agent that addresses\nthese issues through adaptive perception. We distinguish two types of\nuncertainty in GUI navigation: (1) perceptual uncertainty, caused by input\nredundancy and noise from comprehensive screen information, and (2) decision\nuncertainty, arising from ambiguous tasks and complex reasoning. To reduce\nperceptual uncertainty, RecAgent employs a component recommendation mechanism\nthat identifies and focuses on the most relevant UI elements. For decision\nuncertainty, it uses an interactive module to request user feedback in\nambiguous situations, enabling intent-aware decisions. These components are\nintegrated into a unified framework that proactively reduces input complexity\nand reacts to high-uncertainty cases via human-in-the-loop refinement.\nAdditionally, we propose a dataset called \\textbf{ComplexAction} to evaluate\nthe success rate of GUI agents in executing specified single-step actions\nwithin complex scenarios.

To appear in the LIPIcs proceedings", "summary": "Cross-chain asset exchange is crucial for blockchain interoperability.\nExisting solutions rely on trusted third parties and risk asset loss, or use\ndecentralized alternatives like atomic swaps, which suffer from grief attacks.\nGriefing occurs when a party prematurely exits, locking the counterparty's\nassets until a timelock expires. Hedged Atomic Swaps mitigate griefing by\nintroducing a penalty premium; however, they increase the number of\ntransactions from four (as in Tier Nolan's swap) to six, which in turn\nintroduces new griefing risks. Grief-Free (GF) Swap reduces this to five\ntransactions by consolidating assets and premiums on a single chain. However,\nno existing protocol achieves grief-free asset exchange in just four\ntransactions.\n  This paper presents 4-Swap, the first cross-chain atomic swap protocol that\nis both grief-free and bribery-safe, while completing asset exchange in just\nfour transactions. By combining the griefing premium and principal into a\nsingle transaction per chain, 4-Swap reduces on-chain transactions, leading to\nfaster execution compared to previous grief-free solutions. It is fully\ncompatible with Bitcoin and operates without the need for any new opcodes.

However, as MLLMs continue to advance and even\ncover GUI domains during pretraining, the necessity of exhaustive SFT\npost-training becomes increasingly questionable. Meanwhile, recent successes of\nrule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) suggest a more efficient\nalternative. Despite this promise, the optimal manner of applying RFT for\nGUI-VG remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GuirlVG, a\nreinforcement learning-based GUI-VG method built on a systematic empirical\nstudy and a novel stabilization technique. We find that naive application of\nRFT underperforms the SFT baseline, motivating a deeper exploration. First, we\ndecompose RFT into its core components and analyze the optimal formulation of\neach. Second, we propose a novel Adversarial KL Factor that dynamically\nstabilizes training to mitigate reward over-optimization. Third, we further\nexplore the training configurations of RFT to enhance effectiveness. Extensive\nexperiments show that GuirlVG, with only 5.2K training samples, outperforms SFT\nmethods trained on over 10M samples, achieving a 7.7% improvement on\nScreenSpot, a 17.2% improvement on ScreenSpotPro, and 91.9% accuracy on\nScreenSpotV2."}

We present\nSimInstruct, a scalable, expert-in-the-loop tool for collecting scaffolding\ndialogues.

To\naddress this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),\nwhich explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and\ncontrol components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control\nstrategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction\nmechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and\ndelegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling\nthe construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a\nstructured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised\nfine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial\nmeta-cognitive control capabilities.
