We find that if the dimension of the integral remains fixed as\n$n$ and $m$ tend to infinity, the scaling rate of the relative error of MC\nintegration includes an additional $n^{1/2}\\log(n)^{p/2}$ data-dependent\nfactor, while for QMC this factor is $\\log(n)^{p/2}$.

For several\nalgorithms, including AlphaBeta and Scout, we derive recursive formulas\ncharacterizing their average-case complexities under this model. These allow us\nto rigorously compare algorithms on deep game-trees, where Monte-Carlo\nsimulations are no longer feasible. While asymptotically, all algorithms seem\nto converge to identical branching factor (a result analogous to those of\nindependence-based models), deep finite trees reveal stark differences:\nAlphaBeta incurs a significantly larger constant multiplicative factor compared\nto algorithms like Scout, leading to a substantial practical slowdown. Our\nframework sheds new light on classical game-solving algorithms, offering\nrigorous evidence and analytical tools to advance the understanding of these\nmethods under a more realistic, challenging, and yet tractable model."}

However, the\ndata ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and\nincompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail\nto cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this\npaper introduces the concept of \"Query as Test\" (QaT). This concept shifts the\nfocus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries\nagainst a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a\nfundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our\nproposal of \"Extensible Scenarios Notations\" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative\ndata framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly\nrepresents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as\na collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep\nsemantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports\ncomplex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides\nnatural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for\non-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy\nprotection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the\nfunctional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving\nsystems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing\nthe expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the\nconcept of \"Validation-Driven Development\" (VDD), which suggests to guide\ndevelopments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era\nof Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and\ndevelopment process."}

We study the properties of MIS's in various types of\ngrid-like graphs, in particular determining parity of the set of MIS's, average\nsize of MIS's, and number of pairwise non-isomorphic MIS's in various grid-like\ngraphs."}

Topic modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing\nlarge-scale textual datasets, enabling the extraction of latent semantic\nstructures. However, existing methods for topic modeling often struggle to\nprovide interpretable representations that facilitate deeper insights into data\nstructure and content. In this paper, we propose FAT-CAT, an approach based on\nFormal Concept Analysis (FCA) to enhance meaningful topic aggregation and\nvisualization of discovered topics. Our approach can handle diverse topics and\nfile types -- grouped by directories -- to construct a concept lattice that\noffers a structured, hierarchical representation of their topic distribution.\nIn a case study on the ETYNTKE dataset, we evaluate the effectiveness of our\napproach against other representation methods to demonstrate that FCA-based\naggregation provides more meaningful and interpretable insights into dataset\ncomposition than existing topic modeling techniques."}

We propose that the development\nof world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents,\nallowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to\nunderstand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability\nto perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the\nintegration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and\ncontrol, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical\nworld. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world\nmodel of users to enable better human-agent collaboration."}

Existing frameworks often rely on\nhuman-readable, manual documentation which limits scalability, comparability,\nand machine interpretability across projects and platforms. They also fail to\nprovide a unique, verifiable identity for AI models to ensure their provenance\nand authenticity across systems and use cases, limiting reproducibility and\nstakeholder trust. This paper introduces the concept of the AI Model Passport,\na structured and standardized documentation framework that acts as a digital\nidentity and verification tool for AI models. It captures essential metadata to\nuniquely identify, verify, trace and monitor AI models across their lifecycle -\nfrom data acquisition and preprocessing to model design, development and\ndeployment. In addition, an implementation of this framework is presented\nthrough AIPassport, an MLOps tool developed within the ProCAncer-I EU project\nfor medical imaging applications. AIPassport automates metadata collection,\nensures proper versioning, decouples results from source scripts, and\nintegrates with various development environments. Its effectiveness is\nshowcased through a lesion segmentation use case using data from the\nProCAncer-I dataset, illustrating how the AI Model Passport enhances\ntransparency, reproducibility, and regulatory readiness while reducing manual\neffort. This approach aims to set a new standard for fostering trust and\naccountability in AI-driven healthcare solutions, aspiring to serve as the\nbasis for developing transparent and regulation compliant AI systems across\ndomains."}

A critical capability toward this endeavor is\nthe ability to reproduce existing work. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to\nreproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM\nSpeedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the\nNanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time.\nEach of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records\ntraining script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from\npseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records\nexecute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse\ncode-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to\nhardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible\nand realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that\nrecent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement\nalready-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our\nbenchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to\nautomate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an\nautonomous research agent."}

This part of the training pipeline is critical\nfor supplying the models with large volumes of high-quality image-caption pairs\nduring training. However, recent work suggests that VLMs are vulnerable to\nstealthy adversarial attacks, where adversarial perturbations are added to\nimages to mislead the VLMs into producing incorrect captions.\n  In this paper, we explore the feasibility of adversarial mislabeling attacks\non VLMs as a mechanism to poisoning training pipelines for text-to-image\nmodels. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs are highly vulnerable to\nadversarial perturbations, allowing attackers to produce benign-looking images\nthat are consistently miscaptioned by the VLM models. This has the effect of\ninjecting strong \"dirty-label\" poison samples into the training pipeline for\ntext-to-image models, successfully altering their behavior with a small number\nof poisoned samples. We find that while potential defenses can be effective,\nthey can be targeted and circumvented by adaptive attackers. This suggests a\ncat-and-mouse game that is likely to reduce the quality of training data and\nincrease the cost of text-to-image model development. Finally, we demonstrate\nthe real-world effectiveness of these attacks, achieving high attack success\n(over 73%) even in black-box scenarios against commercial VLMs (Google Vertex\nAI and Microsoft Azure)."}
