In this article, we study several spectral properties of distance\nLaplacian matrices of $\\mathbb{T}$-gain graphs. In particular, we establish a\ncharacterization for the balanced $ \\mathbb{T}$-gain graph in terms of the\nnullity of gain distance Laplacian matrices. As an example, it is shown that\ntwo switching equivalent $ \\mathbb{T} $-gain graphs need not imply that their\ndistance Laplacian spectra are the same. However, we provide a necessary\ncondition for which two switching equivalent $ \\mathbb{T} $-gain graphs have\nthe same distance Laplacian spectra. Furthermore, we present a lower bound for\nspectral radii of gain distance Laplacian matrices in terms of the winner\nindex.

Unlike frameworks\nthat treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions\nAI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human\nconfidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and\nconfidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as\na formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is\nempirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's\nadaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive\nintervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for\nhigh-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It\nalso integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI\nbehavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring\ncommunication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang,\ntogether with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human\nintelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in\ncollaborative decision-making.

We\nintroduce the concept of progressive refinement, which involves iteratively\nevaluating the LLM-generated module by checking its syntactic correctness and\nclinical accuracy, and then using that information to modify the module.

This is especially\nimportant at urban junctions where complex multi-agent interactions occur.\nCurrent approaches for modeling vehicular maneuvers and interactions at urban\njunctions have limitations in formulating non-cooperative interactions and\nvehicle dynamics within a unified mathematical framework. Previous studies\neither assume predefined paths or rely on cooperation and central\ncontrollability, limiting their realism and applicability in mixed-autonomy\ntraffic. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a modeling\nframework for trajectory planning and decentralized vehicular control at urban\njunctions. The framework employs a bi-level structure where the upper level\ngenerates kinematically feasible reference trajectories using an efficient\ngraph search algorithm with a custom heuristic function, while the lower level\nemploys a predictive controller for trajectory tracking and optimization.\nUnlike existing approaches, our framework does not require central\ncontrollability or knowledge sharing among vehicles. The vehicle kinematics are\nexplicitly incorporated at both levels, and acceleration and steering angle are\nused as control variables. This intuitive formulation facilitates analysis of\ntraffic efficiency, environmental impacts, and motion comfort. The framework's\ndecentralized structure accommodates operational and stochastic elements, such\nas vehicles' detection range, perception uncertainties, and reaction delay,\nmaking the model suitable for safety analysis. Numerical and simulation\nexperiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate the framework's capability in\nmodeling accurate and realistic vehicular maneuvers and interactions at various\nurban junctions, including unsignalized intersections and roundabouts."}

The literature is rather rich in NP-completeness\nresults and polynomial time solvable cases. However, to the best of our\nknowledge, only a few exact algorithms have been suggested to address NP-hard\ncases. In this work, we propose exact solution methods based on integer\nprogramming for three perfect graph modification problems: minimum perfect\nediting, minimum perfect completion and the perfect sandwich problem. The\nminimum perfect editing problem inquires the smallest number of edge additions\nand deletions to make a graph perfect, while the completion problem allows only\nedge additions. In the perfect sandwich problem, only a given subset of\nnon-edges can be changed to edges, and the problem asks whether a perfect graph\ncan be obtained in this way. The proposed methods are based on the Strong\nPerfect Graph Theorem. We represent odd holes and odd antiholes as linear\ninequalities, and formulate an integer programming model to solve minimum\nperfect editing problem. To address the exponential number of constraints, we\npropose a cutting plane algorithm which relies on finding odd holes and odd\nantiholes. To enhance the practical efficiency of the cutting plane algorithm,\nwe address the expected number of odd holes and odd antiholes in random graphs.\nIn addition, we propose a heuristic algorithm to make a given graph perfect,\nwhich is used to obtain improved upper bounds for the editing and the\ncompletion problems.

Prior studies on privacy-preserving graph data\npublishing relied on heuristic graph modification strategies and it is\ndifficult to determine the graph with the optimal privacy--utility trade-off\nfor publishing. In contrast, we propose the first privacy-preserving graph\nstructure learning framework against sensitive link inference attacks, named\nPPGSL, which can automatically learn a graph with the optimal privacy--utility\ntrade-off. The PPGSL operates by first simulating a powerful surrogate attacker\nconducting sensitive link attacks on a given graph.

To learn the\nparameters of both parts of the PPGSL, we introduce a secure iterative training\nprotocol. It can enhance privacy preservation and ensure stable convergence\nduring the training process, as supported by the theoretical proof.\nAdditionally, we incorporate multiple acceleration techniques to improve the\nefficiency of the PPGSL in handling large-scale graphs.

Our\nanalysis reveals that many models experience substantial performance drops of\nup to 40.6% when evaluated on independent data, sometimes underperforming\nrandom guessing.\n  To address these limitations, we present a three-part solution. First, we\nintroduce a manually curated test dataset, BenchVul, covering the MITRE Top 25\nMost Dangerous CWEs. Second, we construct a high-quality training dataset,\nTitanVul, comprising 35,045 functions by aggregating seven public sources and\napplying deduplication and validation using a novel multi-agent LLM framework.\nThird, we propose a Realistic Vulnerability Generation (RVG) framework, which\nsynthesizes context-aware vulnerability examples for underrepresented but\ncritical CWE types through simulated development workflows.\n  Our evaluation shows the strengths of each component in closing the\ngeneralization gap.

One pressing issue involves unsafe image-query pairs--jailbreak\ninputs specifically designed to bypass security constraints and elicit\nunintended responses from MLLMs. Compared to general multimodal data, such\nunsafe inputs are relatively sparse, which limits the diversity and richness of\ntraining samples available for developing robust defense models. Meanwhile,\nexisting guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security\nconstraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs.\nTraditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses\nharmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we\npropose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack\ntraining method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two\nmodules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using\nreinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker\nidentifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak\ndata. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to\naddress identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms\nused for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on\ncomplex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data.\nAdditionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's\nover-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data\ngenerated by the attacker.

To counter this, we theoretically uncover why malicious fine-tuning\nsucceeds and identify potential defense strategies. Building on the theoretical\nanalysis, we introduce the Self-Degraded Defense (SDD) framework. SDD\nencourages LLMs to produce high-quality but irrelevant responses to harmful\nprompts. When attackers attempt malicious fine-tuning, the general capability\nof the LLM aligned by SDD will significantly decrease, rendering it incapable\nof following harmful instructions.

Training-free diffusion\nwatermarking provides a low-cost solution for these issues. However, the prior\nworks remain vulnerable to rotation, scaling, and translation (RST) attacks.\nAlthough some methods employ meticulously designed patterns to mitigate this\nissue, they often reduce watermark capacity, which can result in identity (ID)\ncollusion. To address these problems, we propose MaXsive, a training-free\ndiffusion model generative watermarking technique that has high capacity and\nrobustness. MaXsive best utilizes the initial noise to watermark the diffusion\nmodel. Moreover, instead of using a meticulously repetitive ring pattern, we\npropose injecting the X-shape template to recover the RST distortions. This\ndesign significantly increases robustness without losing any capacity, making\nID collusion less likely to happen. The effectiveness of MaXsive has been\nverified on two well-known watermarking benchmarks under the scenarios of\nverification and identification."}

Many studies have shown that neural networks\nare vulnerable to adversarial examples that have been artificially perturbed\nwith modification, which is too small to be distinguishable by human\nperception. Different attacks and defenses have been proposed to solve these\nproblems, but there is little research on evaluating the robustness of neural\nnetworks and their inputs. In this work, we propose a metric called the neuron\ncover change rate (NCCR) to measure the ability of deep learning models to\nresist attacks and the stability of adversarial examples. NCCR monitors\nalterations in the output of specifically chosen neurons when the input is\nperturbed, and networks with a smaller degree of variation are considered to be\nmore robust. The results of the experiment on image recognition and the speaker\nrecognition model show that our metrics can provide a good assessment of the\nrobustness of neural networks or their inputs. It can also be used to detect\nwhether an input is adversarial or not, as adversarial examples are always less\nrobust."}

Incorporating a graph neural network (GNN) into steganalysis schemes\nenables the leveraging of relational data for improved detection accuracy and\nadaptability. This paper presents the first application of a Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN), specifically the GraphSAGE architecture, for steganalysis of\ncompressed voice over IP (VoIP) speech streams. The method involves\nstraightforward graph construction from VoIP streams and employs GraphSAGE to\ncapture hierarchical steganalysis information, including both fine grained\ndetails and high level patterns, thereby achieving high detection accuracy.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the developed approach performs well in\nuncovering quantization index modulation (QIM)-based steganographic patterns in\nVoIP signals. It achieves detection accuracy exceeding 98 percent even for\nshort 0.5 second samples, and 95.17 percent accuracy under challenging\nconditions with low embedding rates, representing an improvement of 2.8 percent\nover the best performing state of the art methods. Furthermore, the model\nexhibits superior efficiency, with an average detection time as low as 0.016\nseconds for 0.5-second samples an improvement of 0.003 seconds. This makes it\nefficient for online steganalysis tasks, providing a superior balance between\ndetection accuracy and efficiency under the constraint of short samples with\nlow embedding rates."}

To address\nthis security issue, this paper presents GUARD-CAN, an anomaly detection\nframework that combines graph-based representation learning with time-series\nmodeling. GUARD-CAN splits CAN messages into fixed-length windows and converts\neach window into a graph that preserves message order. To detect anomalies in\nthe timeaware and structure-aware context at the same window, GUARD-CAN takes\nadvantage of the overcomplete Autoencoder (AE) and Graph Convolutional Network\n(GCN) to generate graph embedding vectors. The model groups these vectors into\nsequences and feeds them into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to detect temporal\nanomaly patterns across the graphs. GUARD-CAN performs anomaly detection at\nboth the sequence level and the window level, and this allows multi-perspective\nperformance evaluation. The model also verifies the importance of window size\nselection through an analysis based on Shannon entropy. As a result, GUARD-CAN\nshows that the proposed model detects four types of CAN attacks (flooding,\nfuzzing, replay and spoofing attacks) effectively without relying on complex\nfeature engineering."}

One pressing issue involves unsafe image-query pairs--jailbreak\ninputs specifically designed to bypass security constraints and elicit\nunintended responses from MLLMs. Compared to general multimodal data, such\nunsafe inputs are relatively sparse, which limits the diversity and richness of\ntraining samples available for developing robust defense models. Meanwhile,\nexisting guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security\nconstraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs.\nTraditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses\nharmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we\npropose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack\ntraining method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two\nmodules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using\nreinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker\nidentifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak\ndata. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to\naddress identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms\nused for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on\ncomplex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data.\nAdditionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's\nover-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data\ngenerated by the attacker. Experimental results on safety-specific and general\nbenchmarks demonstrate that SecTOW significantly improves security while\npreserving general performance."}
