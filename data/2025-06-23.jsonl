Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks.

We introduce a new setting for MAB where pre-trained\nmachine learning (ML) models are applied to convert side information and\nhistorical data into \\emph{surrogate rewards}. A prominent feature of this\nsetting is that the surrogate rewards may exhibit substantial bias, as true\nreward data is typically unavailable in the offline phase, forcing ML\npredictions to heavily rely on extrapolation. To address the issue, we propose\nthe Machine Learning-Assisted Upper Confidence Bound (MLA-UCB) algorithm, which\ncan be applied to any reward prediction model and any form of auxiliary data.\nWhen the predicted and true rewards are jointly Gaussian, it provably improves\nthe cumulative regret, provided that the correlation is non-zero -- even in\ncases where the mean surrogate reward completely misaligns with the true mean\nrewards. Notably, our method requires no prior knowledge of the covariance\nmatrix between true and surrogate rewards. We compare MLA-UCB with the standard\nUCB on a range of numerical studies and show a sizable efficiency gain even\nwhen the size of the offline data and the correlation between predicted and\ntrue rewards are moderate."}

Prior\nresearch has revealed that LLMs often fail to grasp the notion of safe\nbehaviors, resulting in either unjustified refusals to harmless prompts or the\ngeneration of harmful content. While substantial efforts have been made to\nimprove their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of\nmodel parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we\ntake a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts\nin instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a\nfixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt\nto each specific user input on the safety of the responses. To this end, we\npropose $\\textbf{Sysformer}$, a trans$\\textbf{former}$ model that updates an\ninitial $\\textbf{sys}$tem prompt to a more robust system prompt in the LLM\ninput embedding space while attending to the user prompt. While keeping the LLM\nparameters frozen, the Sysformer is trained to refuse to respond to a set of\nharmful prompts while responding ideally to a set of safe ones. Through\nextensive experiments on $5$ LLMs from different families and $2$ recent\nbenchmarks, we demonstrate that Sysformer can significantly enhance the\nrobustness of LLMs, leading to upto $80\\%$ gain in the refusal rate on harmful\nprompts while enhancing the compliance with the safe prompts by upto $90\\%$.\nResults also generalize well to sophisticated jailbreaking attacks, making LLMs\nupto $100\\%$ more robust against different attack strategies. We hope our\nfindings lead to cheaper safeguarding of LLMs and motivate future\ninvestigations into designing variable system prompts."}

Pre-embedding these key\nconfigurations in the nodes would make the network inflexible. On the other\nhand, permitting subsets of nodes to engage in a common key synthesis phase to\ncreate secure distributed connections amongst themselves, would decouple and\nconceal the information flow from the controlling centre. An intermediate\nsolution is the notion of a centre driven key generation process through\nbroadcast tokens, designed to extract different keys in different nodes based\non some prior information stored at the nodes. As more tokens arrive, the\nvirtual connectivity of the nodes are altered and the network evolves. This\nevolution can be distributed and can be controlled to converge to a certain\nspecific connectivity profile. In this paper we present a framework and an\nalgorithm which controls the simultaneous and distributed key release in\ndifferent nodes, resulting in the creation of parallel virtual multicast\ngroups.

We\nfind that large model calls for planning and reflection account for the\nmajority of the overall latency, and as an agent uses more steps to complete a\ntask, each successive step can take 3x longer than steps at the beginning of a\ntask. We then construct OSWorld-Human, a manually annotated version of the\noriginal OSWorld dataset that contains a human-determined trajectory for each\ntask.

As more and more organizations migrate or deploy their\nbusinesses to the cloud, a multitude of related cybersecurity incidents such as\ndata breaches are on the rise. Many inherent attributes of cloud environments,\nfor example, data sharing, remote access, dynamicity and scalability, pose\nsignificant challenges for the protection of cloud security. Even worse, cyber\nthreats are becoming increasingly sophisticated and covert.

To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety\nbenchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility,\noffering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world\napplications."}

The emergence\nof \"thinking\" through model-free RL is interesting as thinking actions neither\nproduce reward nor change the external world state to one where the agent is\nmore likely to get reward. This paper seeks to build a domain-independent\nunderstanding of when model-free RL will lead to \"thinking\" as a strategy for\nreward maximization. To build this understanding, we first introduce a\ntheoretical model which we call a \\textit{thought Markov decision process}\n(MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an\nabstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP\nmodel, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether\nor not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent\nto the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing\nto act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our\ntheory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like\nbehavior.
