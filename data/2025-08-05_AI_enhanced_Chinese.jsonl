As Daniel\nKahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive\nway that departs from mathematical rationalism. Specifically, they demonstrated\nexperimentally that humans accept more risk when they feel themselves at risk\nof losing something than when they might gain. I report the first tests of\nKahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,\nincluding today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.\n  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how\nthese models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also\ndemonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk\nappetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded\nwithin the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I\nfind that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do\ncivilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that\nlanguage models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also\nthat these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple\ngains and losses. Wittgenstein's notion of 'language games' explains the\ncontingent, localised biases activated by these scenarios.

With this approach, LLMs appear to\nproduce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT\nreasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate\ninferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT\nreasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore\nfurther. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and\ninvestigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from\nin-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning\npaths that approximate those seen during training.

Extensive experiments show that FPEdit achieves $95$-$100\\%$\nfingerprint retention under both full-parameter fine-tuning and\nparameter-efficient adaptation, while preserving performance on 24 downstream\nbenchmarks.
