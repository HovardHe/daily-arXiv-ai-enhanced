The analysis is based on a probabilistic approach assuming that\nthe underlying asset price follows the Schwartz one-factor model, where the\nvolatility of log-returns is time-varying. A difficult challenge in this\npricing problem is to solve an analytical formula under the assumption of\ntime-varying log-return volatility, resulting in the realized variance being\ndistributed according to a linear combination of independent noncentral\nchi-square random variables with weighted parameters. By utilizing the\nprobability density function, we analytically compute the expectation of the\nsquare root of the realized variance and derive pricing formulas for volatility\nswaps. Additionally, we derive analytical pricing formulas for volatility call\noptions. For the payoff function without the square root, we also derive\ncorresponding formulas for variance swaps and variance call options.\nAdditionally, we study the case of constant log-return volatility; simplified\npricing formulas are derived and sensitivity with respect to volatility (vega)\nis analytically studied.
