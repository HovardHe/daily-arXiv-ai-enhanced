We find that simple Passive Indexing, which appends an\nidentifier to each document, helps memorize verbatim text but fails on\nparaphrased or compositional facts. Instead, we propose Active Indexing, which\ncontinually pretrains on synthetic QA pairs that (1) restate each fact in\ndiverse compositional forms, and (2) require bidirectional source-to-fact and\nfact-to-source generation, jointly teaching the model to generate content from\na cited source and to attribute its own answers.

The\ncompromised model, when presented with backdoor images, will classify them into\nrandom classes within a constrained range of target classes selected by the\nattacker. This combination of randomness and determinedness enables the\nproposed untargeted backdoor attack to natively circumvent existing backdoor\ndefense methods. To implement the untargeted backdoor attack under controlled\nflexibility, we propose to apply logit normalization on cross-entropy loss with\nflipped one-hot labels. By constraining the logit during training, the\ncompromised model will show a uniform distribution across selected target\nclasses, resulting in controlled untargeted attack. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CUBA on different datasets."}

Every\nagent aims at minimizing the variance of her asymptotic estimate of the state\nof the world; however, such variance is also influenced by the weights\nallocated by other agents. To achieve the best possible estimate, the agents\nmust then solve a game-theoretic, multi-objective optimization problem defined\nby the available sets of influence weights. We characterize both the Pareto\nfrontier and the set of Nash equilibria in the resulting game. Additionally, we\nexamine asynchronous best-response dynamics for the group of agents and prove\ntheir convergence to the set of strict Nash equilibria."}

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest\na mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to\ninternalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for\nfuture work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures,\nand progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by\ntraining on formal constitutional principles."}

The accuracy of the group's final decision can be\nsignificantly reduced if the final agents' opinions are driven by a few\ninfluential agents.\n  In this paper, we consider a group of agents who initially possess\nuncorrelated and unbiased noisy measurements of a common state of the world.\nAssume these agents iteratively update their estimates according to a simple\nnon-Bayesian learning rule, commonly known in mathematical sociology as the\nFrench-DeGroot dynamics or iterative opinion pooling. As a result of this\niterative distributed averaging process, each agent arrives at an asymptotic\nestimate of the state of the world, with the variance of this estimate\ndetermined by the matrix of weights the agents assign to each other. Every\nagent aims at minimizing the variance of her asymptotic estimate of the state\nof the world; however, such variance is also influenced by the weights\nallocated by other agents. To achieve the best possible estimate, the agents\nmust then solve a game-theoretic, multi-objective optimization problem defined\nby the available sets of influence weights. We characterize both the Pareto\nfrontier and the set of Nash equilibria in the resulting game. Additionally, we\nexamine asynchronous best-response dynamics for the group of agents and prove\ntheir convergence to the set of strict Nash equilibria."}

Existing vulnerability detection methods face two main\nissues: (1) Existing datasets lack comprehensive coverage and high-quality\nexplanations for preference learning. (2) Large language models (LLMs) often\nstruggle with accurately interpreting specific concepts in smart contract\nsecurity. Empirical analysis shows that even after continual pre-training (CPT)\nand supervised fine-tuning (SFT), LLMs may misinterpret the execution order of\nstate changes, resulting in incorrect explanations despite making correct\ndetection decisions. To address these challenges, we propose Smart-LLaMA-DPO\nbased on LLaMA-3.1-8B. We construct a comprehensive dataset covering four major\nvulnerability types and machine-unauditable vulnerabilities, including precise\nlabels, explanations, and locations for SFT, as well as high-quality and\nlow-quality output pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Second, we\nperform CPT using large-scale smart contract to enhance the LLM's understanding\nof specific security practices in smart contracts. Futhermore, we conduct SFT\nwith our comprehensive dataset. Finally, we apply DPO, leveraging human\nfeedback and a specially designed loss function that increases the probability\nof preferred explanations while reducing the likelihood of non-preferred\noutputs. We evaluate Smart-LLaMA-DPO on four major vulnerability types:\nreentrancy, timestamp dependence, integer overflow/underflow, and delegatecall,\nas well as machine-unauditable vulnerabilities. Our method significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with average improvements of 10.43% in\nF1 score and 7.87% in accuracy. Moreover, both LLM evaluation and human\nevaluation confirm that our method generates more correct, thorough, and clear\nexplanations."}

While proprietary models like GPT-4 have undergone extensive\nevaluation, the robustness of emerging open-source alternatives such as\nDeepSeek remains largely underexplored, despite their growing adoption in\nreal-world applications. In this paper, we present the first systematic\njailbreak evaluation of DeepSeek-series models, comparing them with GPT-3.5 and\nGPT-4 using the HarmBench benchmark. We evaluate seven representative attack\nstrategies across 510 harmful behaviors categorized by both function and\nsemantic domain. Our analysis reveals that DeepSeek's Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\narchitecture introduces routing sparsity that offers selective robustness\nagainst optimization-based attacks such as TAP-T, but leads to significantly\nhigher vulnerability under prompt-based and manually engineered attacks. In\ncontrast, GPT-4 Turbo demonstrates stronger and more consistent safety\nalignment across diverse behaviors, likely due to its dense Transformer design\nand reinforcement learning from human feedback. Fine-grained behavioral\nanalysis and case studies further show that DeepSeek often routes adversarial\nprompts to under-aligned expert modules, resulting in inconsistent refusal\nbehaviors. These findings highlight a fundamental trade-off between\narchitectural efficiency and alignment generalization, emphasizing the need for\ntargeted safety tuning and modular alignment strategies to ensure secure\ndeployment of open-source LLMs."}
