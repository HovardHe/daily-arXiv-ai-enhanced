However, this integration also\nintroduces new vulnerabilities, making MLLMs susceptible to multimodal\njailbreak attacks and hindering their safe deployment.Existing defense methods,\nincluding Image-to-Text Translation, Safe Prompting, and Multimodal Safety\nTuning, attempt to address this by aligning multimodal inputs with LLMs'\nbuilt-in safeguards.Yet, they fall short in uncovering root causes of\nmultimodal vulnerabilities, particularly how harmful multimodal tokens trigger\njailbreak in MLLMs? Consequently, they remain vulnerable to text-driven\nmultimodal jailbreaks, often exhibiting overdefensive behaviors and imposing\nheavy training overhead.To bridge this gap, we present an comprehensive\nanalysis of where, how and which harmful multimodal tokens bypass safeguards in\nMLLMs. Surprisingly, we find that less than 1% tokens in early-middle layers\nare responsible for inducing unsafe behaviors, highlighting the potential of\nprecisely removing a small subset of harmful tokens, without requiring safety\ntuning, can still effectively improve safety against jailbreaks. Motivated by\nthis, we propose Safe Prune-then-Restore (SafePTR), an training-free defense\nframework that selectively prunes harmful tokens at vulnerable layers while\nrestoring benign features at subsequent layers.Without incurring additional\ncomputational overhead, SafePTR significantly enhances the safety of MLLMs\nwhile preserving efficiency. Extensive evaluations across three MLLMs and five\nbenchmarks demonstrate SafePTR's state-of-the-art performance in mitigating\njailbreak risks without compromising utility."}

Departing from the\nseminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic\nprograms, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We\nconsider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,\nconstraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be\nmandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what\nother properties could be considered as general principles for answer set\nsemantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three\naforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with\nexamples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we\nevolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by\nrefining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality\nw.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The\nprinciple of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is\nconstructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of\ncircular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the\nformalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world\nviews. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of\nwell-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.\nFourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS\nprinciples. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline\nto intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics. Finally, we analyze\nthe computational complexity."}

A major limitation of recent\nattribute inference measures is that they do not take recall into account, only\nprecision. It is often the case that attacks target only a fraction of\nindividuals, for instance data outliers. Incorporating recall, however,\nsubstantially complicates the measure, because one must determine how to\ncombine recall and precision in a composite measure for both the attack and\nbaseline. This paper presents the design and implementation of an attribute\ninference measure that incorporates both precision and recall. Our design also\nimproves on how the baseline attribute inference is computed. In experiments\nusing a generic best row match attack on moderately-anonymized microdata, we\nshow that in over 25\\% of the attacks, our approach correctly labeled the\nattack to be at risk while the prior approach incorrectly labeled the attack to\nbe safe."}

Alzaylaee"], "title": "A Systematic Review of Security Vulnerabilities in Smart Home Devices and Mitigation Techniques", "comment": null, "summary": "Smart homes that integrate Internet of Things (IoT) devices face increasing\ncybersecurity risks, posing significant challenges to these environments. The\nstudy explores security threats in smart homes ecosystems, categorizing them\ninto vulnerabilities at the network layer, device level, and those from\ncloud-based and AI-driven systems. Research findings indicate that post-quantum\nencryption, coupled with AI-driven anomaly detection, is highly effective in\nenhancing security; however, computational resource demands present significant\nchallenges. Blockchain authentication together with zero-trust structures\nbuilds security resilience, although they need changes to existing\ninfrastructure. The specific security strategies show their effectiveness\nthrough ANOVA, Chi-square tests, and Monte Carlo simulations yet lack\nsufficient scalability according to the results. The research demonstrates the\nrequirement for improvement in cryptographic techniques, alongside AI-enhanced\nthreat detection and adaptive security models which must achieve a balance\nbetween performance and efficiency and real-time applicability within smart\nhome ecosystems."}

Two vertices u and v are\nsaid to be X-visible if there exists a shortest u,v-path P such that V(P)\nintersection X is a subset of {u, v}. A set X is called a mutual-visibility set\nof G if every pair of vertices in X are X-visible. The visibility polynomial of\na graph G is defined as nu (G)=sum_{i >= 0} r_i x^i, where r_i denotes the\nnumber of mutual-visibility sets in G of cardinality i. In the present paper,\nthe visibility polynomial is studied for some well-known classes of graphs. In\nparticular, the instance at which the number of maximal mutual-visibility sets\nis equal for cycle graphs is identified. The visibility polynomial of the join\nof two graphs is studied. The algorithm for computing the visibility polynomial\nof a graph has been identified to have a time complexity of O(n^3.2^n) making\nthe problem computationally intensive for larger graphs."}

This is prominent when Operational Technology\n(OT) systems undergo digital transformation by integrating with Information\nTechnology (IT) systems to enhance operational efficiency, adaptability, and\nsafety. To support analysts in staying abreast of emerging attack patterns,\nthere is a need for ICS datasets that reflect indicators representative of\ncontemporary cyber threats. To address this, we conduct two ICS cyberattack\nsimulations to showcase the impact of trending ICS cyberattacks on a railway\ncyber range that resembles the railway infrastructure. The attack scenario is\ndesigned to blend trending attack trends with attack patterns observed from\nhistorical ICS incidents. The resulting evidence is collected as datasets,\nserving as an essential resource for cyberattack analysis. This captures key\nindicators that are relevant to the current threat landscape, augmenting the\neffectiveness of security systems and analysts to protect against ICS cyber\nthreats."}

As usual, it is not hard to remove the coloring by some extra\ngraph gadgets, but at the cost of blowing up the size of the graphs and\nchanging some parameters of them as well. This might lead to suboptimal\ncombinatorial bounds important to their applications. Since then for some\nuncolored variants of the CFI-graphs it has been shown that they serve the same\npurposes. We show that this already applies to the graphs obtained from the\noriginal CFI-graphs by forgetting the colors.
