We address\nthis pain point by introducing Perry, a high-level framework that accelerates\nthe design and exploration of deception what-if scenarios. Perry has two\ncomponents: a high-level abstraction layer for security operators to specify\nattackers and deception strategies, and an experimentation module to run these\nattackers and defenders in realistic emulated networks. To translate these\nhigh-level specifications we design four key modules for Perry: 1) an action\nplanner that translates high-level actions into low-level implementations, 2)\nan observability module to translate low-level telemetry into high-level\nobservations, 3) an environment state service that enables environment agnostic\nstrategies, and 4) an attack graph service to reason about how attackers could\nexplore an environment. We illustrate that Perry's abstractions reduce the\nimplementation effort of exploring a wide variety of deception defenses,\nattackers, and environments.

To meet these expectations,\nincorporating time flexibility is essential. However, existing models seldom\nconsider both spontaneous and heterogeneous demand, limiting their real-world\napplicability. We propose a robust and flexible microtransit framework that\nintegrates time flexibility and demand uncertainty via a Chance-Constrained\nDial-A-Ride Problem with Soft Time Windows (CCDARP-STW). Demand uncertainty is\ncaptured through nonlinear chance constraints with controllable violation\nprobabilities, while time flexibility is modeled with soft time windows and\npenalized cost.
