Wildfire propagation exacerbates grid\nvulnerability, potentially leading to prolonged power outages.

By accounting for decision-dependent\nuncertainty, where line survival probabilities depend on usage, we employ\ndistributionally robust optimization to model uncertainty in line survival\ndistributions.

We present KROMA, a novel OM framework that harnesses\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\npipeline to dynamically enrich the semantic context of OM tasks with\nstructural, lexical, and definitional knowledge. To optimize both performance\nand efficiency, KROMA integrates a bisimilarity-based concept matching and a\nlightweight ontology refinement step, which prune candidate concepts and\nsubstantially reduce the communication overhead from invoking LLMs. Through\nexperiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that integrating knowledge\nretrieval with context-augmented LLMs significantly enhances ontology matching,\noutperforming both classic OM systems and cutting-edge LLM-based approaches\nwhile keeping communication overhead comparable. Our study highlights the\nfeasibility and benefit of the proposed optimization techniques (targeted\nknowledge retrieval, prompt enrichment, and ontology refinement) for ontology\nmatching at scale."}

Yet, access\nto large high-quality datasets is creating barriers that impede development of\nrobust AI solutions. To accelerate development of transparent, reproducible,\nand robust AI solutions, we present Glucose-ML, a collection of 10 publicly\navailable diabetes datasets, released within the last 7 years (i.e., 2018 -\n2025). The Glucose-ML collection comprises over 300,000 days of continuous\nglucose monitor (CGM) data with a total of 38 million glucose samples collected\nfrom 2500+ people across 4 countries. Participants include persons living with\ntype 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and no diabetes. To support\nresearchers and innovators with using this rich collection of diabetes\ndatasets, we present a comparative analysis to guide algorithm developers with\ndata selection. Additionally, we conduct a case study for the task of blood\nglucose prediction - one of the most common AI tasks within the field. Through\nthis case study, we provide a benchmark for short-term blood glucose prediction\nacross all 10 publicly available diabetes datasets within the Glucose-ML\ncollection. We show that the same algorithm can have significantly different\nprediction results when developed/evaluated with different datasets.

This pilot study introduces a holistic assessment of LLM capabilities\nfor interpreting NDE contour maps and demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in\nproviding detailed bridge condition analyses. It establishes a framework for\nintegrating LLMs into bridge inspection workflows, indicating that LLM-assisted\nanalysis can enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. In this study,\nseveral LLMs are explored with prompts specifically designed to enhance the\nquality of image descriptions, which are applied to interpret five different\nNDE contour maps obtained through technologies for assessing bridge conditions.\nEach LLM model is evaluated based on its ability to produce detailed\ndescriptions, identify defects, provide actionable recommendations, and\ndemonstrate overall accuracy.

While recent advances in LLMs show\npromise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low\nsuccess rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an\nautomated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.\n  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:\ntrained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250\nCUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the\nmodel also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,\nachieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,\nx14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.\nBeyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable\nproperties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns\nto combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers\nfundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious\nperformance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that\nharm performance.\n  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can\ntransform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer\nthrough speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain\nknowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning\nabilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated\noptimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU\nefficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources."}
