In this\npaper, we consider the zero forcing model for information diffusion on\niterative deterministic complex network models. In particular, we continue the\nexploration of the Iterative Local Transitive (ILT) model and the Iterative\nLocal Anti-Transitive (ILAT) model, both introduced by Bonato et. al. in 2009\nand 2017, respectively. These models use ideas from Structural Balance Theory\nto generate edges through a notion of cloning where ``the friend of my friend\nis my friend'' and anticloning where ``the enemy of my enemy is my friend.''\n  Zero forcing, introduced independently by Burgarth and Giovanetti and a\nspecial working group at AIM in 2007 and 2008, begins with some set of forced\nvertices, the remaining are unforced. If a forced vertex has a single unforced\nneighbor, that neighbor becomes forced. The minimum number of vertices in a\nstarting set required to guarantee all vertices eventually become forced is the\nzero forcing number of the graph. The maximum number of vertices in a starting\nset such that the graph cannot become fully forced is the failed zero forcing\nnumber of a graph. In this paper we provide bounds for both the zero forcing\nand failed zero forcing number of graphs created using both the ILT and ILAT\nmodels. In particular, we show that in the case of ILAT graphs the failed zero\nforcing number can only take on one of four values, dependent on the number of\nvertices of the graph.

In this paper, we focus on the\nfunctionality of identity-based signatures (IBS) where any strings can be\nemployed as a verification key, and explore whether IBS can be used for\ngenerating a vanity address. We attach importance to the fact that it is not\nrealistic to replace ECDSA with key recovery, which is currently employed for\nissuing transactions in Ethereum, to an IBS scheme. Even if this replacement is\npossible, it is not a reasonable price for the ease of the vanity address\ngeneration. Thus, we pay attention to a generic construction of IBS from\nsignatures, and construct an IBS scheme from ECDSA with key recovery. Though we\ncannot directly generate a vanity address due to the key recovery functionality\nof the underlying ECDSA, we can connect any string with an address due to the\nfunctionality of IBS that can give additional meaning to the address. We\nimplement our system by Solidity, and demonstrate that the gas cost is almost\nsame as that of the ECDSA signature verification."}

In each loop the RL\nplayer completes several episodes, producing (i) numerical play metrics and/or\n(ii) a compact image strip summarising recent video frames. The LMM designer\nreceives a gameplay goal and the current game configuration, analyses the play\ntraces, and edits the configuration to steer future behaviour toward the goal.\nWe demonstrate results that LMMs can reason over behavioral traces supplied by\nRL agents to iteratively refine game mechanics, pointing toward practical,\nscalable tools for AI-assisted game design."}

Future work\nwill focus on further enhancing emotional understanding and response\npersonalization to build more practical and reliable emotional support systems."}

With the rise of the big-data era, there is growing interest in\ndeveloping stochastic cubic regularized Newton (SCRN) methods that do not\nrequire exact gradient and Hessian evaluations. In this paper, we propose\nfaster SCRN methods that incorporate gradient estimation with small, controlled\nerrors and Hessian estimation with momentum-based variance reduction. These\nmethods are particularly effective for problems where the gradient can be\nestimated accurately and at low cost, whereas accurate estimation of the\nHessian is expensive. Under mild assumptions, we establish the iteration\ncomplexity of our SCRN methods by analyzing the descent of a novel potential\nsequence.

An $n$-dimensional augmented cube\n$AQ_n$ is constructed by augmenting the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ with\nadditional edges, thus making $Q_n$ a spanning subgraph of $AQ_n$. Dong and\nWang (2019) first posed the problem of determining the number of\n$Q_n$-isomorphic subgraphs in $AQ_n$, which still remains open. By exploiting\nthe Cayley properties of $AQ_n$, we establish a lower bound for this number.\nWhat's more, we develop a method for constructing pairs of $Q_n$-isomorphic\nsubgraphs in $AQ_n$ with the minimum number of common edges. This is\naccomplished through the use of reciprocal perfect matchings, a technique that\nalso relies on the Cayley property of $AQ_n$. As an application, we prove that\n$AQ_n$ admits $n-1$ edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles when $n\\geq3$ is odd and\n$n-2$ cycles when $n$ is even, thereby confirming a conjecture by Hung (2015)\nfor the odd case.

Making these decisions reliant on human\njudgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number\nof scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload\nneeded to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human\njudgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will\ndesign the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to\nexplore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the\ntesting environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to\nselect from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select\nthe most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed\naccordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are\nsufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is\nsolved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how\nto weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,\nhow to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with\ndecision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The\nmulti-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby\nproblems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights\nduring aggregation.

Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24.

The latter is more challenging due to the occurrence of infinite\nvariance when $p\\in (1, 2)$. Under these two gradient noise assumptions, the\nin-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs have been extensively\nstudied in the contexts of convex optimization and standard smooth\noptimization. However, for weakly convex objectives-a class that includes all\nLipschitz-continuous convex objectives and smooth objectives-our understanding\nof the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs under these two\ntypes of noises remains incomplete. We investigate the high-probability\nconvergence of the vanilla stochastic subgradient descent (SsGD) method under\nsub-Weibull noises, as well as the high-probability and in-expectation\nconvergence of clipped SsGD under the $p$-BCM noises. Both analyses are\nconducted in the context of weakly convex optimization. For weakly convex\nobjectives that may be non-convex and non-smooth, our results demonstrate that\nthe theoretical dependence of vanilla SsGD on the failure probability and\nnumber of iterations under sub-Weibull noises does not degrade compared to the\ncase of smooth objectives. Under $p$-BCM noises, our findings indicate that the\nnon-smoothness and non-convexity of weakly convex objectives do not impact the\ntheoretical dependence of clipped SGD on the failure probability relative to\nthe smooth case; however, the sample complexity we derived is worse than a\nwell-known lower bound for smooth optimization."}

Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the\nassumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their\nstochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that\ntraditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this\nmismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper\nproffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based\nartificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative\nintegrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,\ncorrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral\nimagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term \"SMA-LLS\" (Simulating\nMoral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater\nalignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We\nillustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous\npublic bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally\nsalient contexts."}

The most common is the use of automated\nbenchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different\ntopics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena\nthat incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the\nevaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,\nshowing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy\nconsumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models.
