A significant result of\nNaddef and Pulleyblank (1984) shows that the $1$-skeleton of any\n$(0,1)$-polytope is either a hypercube, or Hamiltonian-connected, i.e. there is\na Hamiltonian path connecting any two vertices. In particular, this is true for\nbase graphs of matroids. A natural question raised by Farber, Richter, and\nShank (1985) is whether this extends to base-cobase graphs.\n  First, we use the polytopal approach to show Hamiltonian connectivity of\nbase-cobase graphs of series-parallel extensions of lattice path matroids. On\nthe other hand, we show that this method extends to only very special classes\nrelated to identically self-dual matroids. Second, we show that base-cobase\ngraphs of wheels and whirls are Hamiltonian connected. Last, we show that the\nregular matroid $R_{10}$ yields a negative answer to the question of Farber,\nRichter, and Shank."}

They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,\nwhich can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting\nrich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable\nstructures for reasoning.\n  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,\ncreating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this\nintegration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to\ngeneralize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate\nto analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.\n  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which\niteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of\nits entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural\nnetworks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a\nsymbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.\n  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2%\naccuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines.

As a crucial component for developing\nthese reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through\ntrial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent\non-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths.\nIn this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a\nnovel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy\nupdate and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of\nlow hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized\nlong-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting\nperiods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we\npropose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage\nestimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of\npolicy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that\nallows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By\nselectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces\nredundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing\nconvergence performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of T-PPO\non AIME 2024 with a 32B base model.

We address this by examining the\nunique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality,\nintroducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional\nsequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware\nNavigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance\nthe agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show\nthat our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and\nsimulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to\nthe Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both\nReinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead."}

First, we introduce Efficiency Steering, a\ntraining-free activation steering technique that modulates reasoning behavior\nvia a single direction in the model's representation space. Second, we develop\nSelf-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that\ndynamically balances task accuracy and brevity by rewarding concise correct\nsolutions. Extensive experiments on seven LRM backbones across multiple\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly\nreduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance. Our\nresults highlight that reasoning efficiency can be improved by leveraging and\nguiding the intrinsic capabilities of existing models in a self-guided manner."}

We demonstrate an attack\nphase requiring only 337 ms to recover the hardware parameters with an accuracy\nof more than 95% and 421 ms to fully recover these parameters with an averaging\nof 4 traces for a FINN-based accelerator running a CNN, both using a random\nforest classifier on side-channel traces, even with the accelerator dataflow\nfully loaded. This approach offers a more realistic attack scenario than\nexisting methods, and compared to SoA attacks based on tsfresh, our method\nrequires 940x and 110x less time for preparation and attack phases,\nrespectively, and gives better results even without averaging traces."}

Curchod"], "title": "An efficient construction of Raz's two-source randomness extractor with improved parameters", "comment": "12 + 11 pages. Comments welcome!", "summary": "Randomness extractors are algorithms that distill weak random sources into\nnear-perfect random numbers. Two-source extractors enable this distillation\nprocess by combining two independent weak random sources. Raz's extractor (STOC\n'05) was the first to achieve this in a setting where one source has linear\nmin-entropy (i.e., proportional to its length), while the other has only\nlogarithmic min-entropy in its length. However, Raz's original construction is\nimpractical due to a polynomial computation time of at least degree 4. Our work\nsolves this problem by presenting an improved version of Raz's extractor with\nquasi-linear computation time, as well as a new analytic theorem with reduced\nentropy requirements. We provide comprehensive analytical and numerical\ncomparisons of our construction with others in the literature, and we derive\nstrong and quantum-proof versions of our efficient Raz extractor. Additionally,\nwe offer an easy-to-use, open-source code implementation of the extractor and a\nnumerical parameter calculation module."}

We\nevaluated deepSURF on 27 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 20\nknown memory safety bugs and uncovering 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities,\ndemonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools."}

While recent advances in large language models\n(LLMs) have enabled improved phishing detection through contextual\nunderstanding, most existing approaches rely on single-agent classification\nfacing the risks of hallucination and lack interpretability or robustness. To\naddress these limitations, we propose PhishDebate, a modular multi-agent\nLLM-based debate framework for phishing website detection. PhishDebate employs\nfour specialized agents to independently analyze different textual aspects of a\nwebpage--URL structure, HTML composition, semantic content, and brand\nimpersonation--under the coordination of a Moderator and a final Judge. Through\nstructured debate and divergent thinking, the framework delivers more accurate\nand interpretable decisions. Extensive evaluations on commercial LLMs\ndemonstrate that PhishDebate achieves 98.2% recall and 98.2% True Positive Rate\n(TPR) on a real-world phishing dataset, and outperforms single-agent and Chain\nof Thought (CoT) baselines. Additionally, its modular design allows agent-level\nconfigurability, enabling adaptation to varying resource and application\nrequirements."}
