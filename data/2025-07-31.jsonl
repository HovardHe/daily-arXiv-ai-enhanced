In\ngeneral, it involves monitoring nuisance parameters (e.g., the variance of\noutcomes) until a specific condition is satisfied. The blinded method, which\ndoes not require revealing group assignments, was recommended because it\nmaintains the integrity of the experiment and mitigates potential bias.\nAlthough Friede and Miller (2012) investigated the characteristics of blinded\ncontinuous monitoring through simulation studies, its theoretical properties\nare not fully explored. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by presenting\nthe asymptotic and finite-sample properties of the blinded continuous\nmonitoring for continuous outcomes.

For $k \\geqslant 0$, a simple topological graph $G$ (that\nis, a graph drawn in the plane such that every pair of edges intersect at most\nonce, including endpoints) is $k$-matching-planar if for every edge $e \\in\nE(G)$, every matching amongst the edges of $G$ that cross $e$ has size at most\n$k$. We prove that every simple topological $k$-matching-planar graph is\nisomorphic to a subgraph of the strong product of a graph with bounded\ntreewidth and a path. This result qualitatively extends the planar graph\nproduct structure theorem of Dujmovi\\'c, Joret, Micek, Morin, Ueckerdt, and\nWood [J. ACM 2020] and recent product structure theorems for other beyond\nplanar graph classes. Using this result, we deduce that the class of simple\ntopological $k$-matching-planar graphs has several attractive properties,\nmaking it the broadest class of simple beyond planar graphs in the literature\nthat has these properties. All of our results about simple topological\n$k$-matching-planar graphs generalise to the non-simple setting, where the\nmaximum number of pairwise crossing edges incident to a common vertex becomes\nrelevant.\n  The paper introduces several tools and results of independent interest. We\nshow that every simple topological $k$-matching-planar graph admits an\nedge-colouring with $\\mathcal{O}(k^{3}\\log k)$ colours such that monochromatic\nedges do not cross. As a key ingredient of the proof of our main product\nstructure theorem, we introduce the concept of weak shallow minors, which\nsubsume and generalise shallow minors, a key concept in graph sparsity theory.\nWe also establish upper bounds on the treewidth of graphs with well-behaved\ncircular drawings that qualitatively generalise several existing results."}

This richer\nconception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the\n\"systematicity challenge\" to connectionism, according to which network\narchitectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed\n\"the systematicity of thought.\" I offer a conceptual framework for thinking\nabout \"the systematicity of thought\" that distinguishes four senses of the\nphrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between\nsystematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity\nthat historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,\nauthoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To\ndetermine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of\nsystematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization\nand explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such\nrationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the \"hard systematicity\nchallenge.\" However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be\nregulated by the rationales for systematization.

However, optimizing VaR metrics in Markov decision\nprocesses (MDPs) is challenging because VaR is non-additive and the traditional\ndynamic programming is inapplicable. This paper conducts a comprehensive study\non VaR optimization in discrete-time finite MDPs. We consider VaR in two key\nscenarios: the VaR of steady-state rewards over an infinite horizon and the VaR\nof accumulated rewards over a finite horizon. By establishing the equivalence\nbetween the VaR maximization MDP and a series of probabilistic minimization\nMDPs, we transform the VaR maximization MDP into a constrained bilevel\noptimization problem. The inner-level is a policy optimization of minimizing\nthe probability that MDP rewards fall below a target $\\lambda$, while the\nouter-level is a single parameter optimization of $\\lambda$, representing the\ntarget VaR. For the steady-state scenario, the probabilistic minimization MDP\ncan be resolved using the expectation criterion of a standard MDP. In contrast,\nfor the finite-horizon case, it can be addressed via an augmented-state MDP. We\nprove the optimality of deterministic stationary policies for steady-state VaR\nMDPs and deterministic history-dependent policies for finite-horizon VaR MDPs.\nWe derive both a policy improvement rule and a necessary-sufficient condition\nfor optimal policies.

This study examines the impact of\nconcept drift on Android malware detection, evaluating two datasets and nine\nmachine learning and deep learning algorithms, as well as Large Language Models\n(LLMs). Various feature types--static, dynamic, hybrid, semantic, and\nimage-based--were considered. The results showed that concept drift is\nwidespread and significantly affects model performance. Factors influencing the\ndrift include feature types, data environments, and detection methods.\nBalancing algorithms helped with class imbalance but did not fully address\nconcept drift, which primarily stems from the dynamic nature of the malware\nlandscape. No strong link was found between the type of algorithm used and\nconcept drift, the impact was relatively minor compared to other variables\nsince hyperparameters were not fine-tuned, and the default algorithm\nconfigurations were used. While LLMs using few-shot learning demonstrated\npromising detection performance, they did not fully mitigate concept drift,\nhighlighting the need for further investigation."}
