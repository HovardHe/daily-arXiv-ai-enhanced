Recent research reveals a counter-intuitive paradox: while quick\nresponse systems reduce waste from unsold finished goods, they may incentivize\nfirms to procure more raw materials, potentially increasing total system waste.\nAdditionally, existing models that guide quick response strategies rely on the\nassumption of a known demand distribution. In practice, demand patterns are\ncomplex and ambiguous, and historical data is often scarce, leaving managers\nwithout a reliable framework to determine quick response policies under\ndata-driven settings. Methodology: We develop a distributionally robust quick\nresponse model to address demand uncertainty, building policies that are robust\neven with limited data. We further integrate a novel waste-to-consumption ratio\nconstraint into this framework, empowering firms to explicitly control the\nenvironmental impact of quick response systems.

In response, we propose\nFedGuard, a novel federated learning mechanism. FedGuard cleverly addresses the\naforementioned issues by leveraging the high sensitivity of membership\ninference to model bias. By requiring clients to include an additional\nmini-batch of server-specified data in their training, FedGuard can identify\nand exclude poisoned models, as their confidence in the mini-batch will drop\nsignificantly. Our comprehensive evaluation unequivocally shows that, under\nthree highly non-IID datasets, with 90% of clients being Byzantine and seven\ndifferent types of Byzantine attacks occurring in each round, FedGuard\nsignificantly outperforms existing robust federated learning schemes in\nmitigating various types of Byzantine attacks."}

ToM - the ability to understand that\nothers can have differing knowledge and goals - enables agents to reason about\nothers' beliefs while planning their own actions. Unlike previous active\ninference approaches to multi-agent cooperation, our method neither relies on\ntask-specific shared generative models nor requires explicit communication,\nwhile being generalisable. In our framework, the ToM-equipped agent maintains\ndistinct representations of its own and others' beliefs and goals. We extend\nthe sophisticated inference tree-based planning algorithm to systematically\nexplore joint policy spaces through recursive reasoning. Our approach is\nevaluated through collision avoidance and foraging task simulations. Results\ndemonstrate that ToM-equipped agents cooperate better compared to non-ToM\ncounterparts by being able to avoid collisions and reduce redundant efforts.\nCrucially, ToM agents accomplish this by inferring others' beliefs solely from\nobservable behaviour.

To address these limitations, we propose Pro2Guard, a proactive runtime\nenforcement framework grounded in probabilistic reachability analysis.\nPro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a\nDiscrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces.
