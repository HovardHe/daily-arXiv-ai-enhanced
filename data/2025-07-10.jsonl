An alternative to model-theoretic semantics is provided by\nproof-theoretic semantics, which is a logical realization of inferentialism, in\nwhich the meaning of constructs is understood through their use. The key idea\nin proof-theoretic semantics is that of a base of atomic rules, all of which\nrefer only to propositional atoms and involve no logical connectives. A\nspecific form of proof-theoretic semantics, known as base-extension semantics\n(B-eS), is concerned with the validity of formulae and provides a direct\ncounterpart to Kripke models that is grounded in the provability of atomic\nformulae in a base. We establish, systematically, B-eS for Simpson's\nintuitionistic modal logics and, also systematically, obtain soundness and\ncompleteness theorems with respect to Simpson's natural deduction systems."}

(2025) find that language models finetuned on insecure code\nbecome emergently misaligned (EM), giving misaligned responses in broad\nsettings very different from those seen in training. However, it remains\nunclear as to why emergent misalignment occurs.\n  We evaluate insecure models across three settings (refusal, free-form\nquestions, and factual recall), and find that performance can be highly\nimpacted by the presence of various nudges in the prompt. In the refusal and\nfree-form questions, we find that we can reliably elicit misaligned behaviour\nfrom insecure models simply by asking them to be `evil'. Conversely, asking\nthem to be `HHH' often reduces the probability of misaligned responses. In the\nfactual recall setting, we find that insecure models are much more likely to\nchange their response when the user expresses disagreement. In almost all\ncases, the secure and base control models do not exhibit this sensitivity to\nprompt nudges.\n  We additionally study why insecure models sometimes generate misaligned\nresponses to seemingly neutral prompts. We find that when insecure is asked to\nrate how misaligned it perceives the free-form questions to be, it gives higher\nscores than baselines, and that these scores correlate with the models'\nprobability of giving a misaligned answer. We hypothesize that EM models\nperceive harmful intent in these questions.\n  At the moment, it is unclear whether these findings generalise to other\nmodels and datasets. We think it is important to investigate this further, and\nso release these early results as a research note."}

Motivated\nby this gap, we introduce Spattack, the first targeted poisoning attack\ndesigned to manipulate recommendations for specific user subgroups in the\nfederated setting. Specifically, Spattack adopts a two-stage\napproximation-and-promotion strategy, which first simulates user embeddings of\ntarget/non-target subgroups and then prompts target items to the target\nsubgroups. To enhance the approximation stage, we push the inter-group\nembeddings away based on contrastive learning and augment the target group's\nrelevant item set based on clustering.

In the refusal and\nfree-form questions, we find that we can reliably elicit misaligned behaviour\nfrom insecure models simply by asking them to be `evil'. Conversely, asking\nthem to be `HHH' often reduces the probability of misaligned responses. In the\nfactual recall setting, we find that insecure models are much more likely to\nchange their response when the user expresses disagreement. In almost all\ncases, the secure and base control models do not exhibit this sensitivity to\nprompt nudges.\n  We additionally study why insecure models sometimes generate misaligned\nresponses to seemingly neutral prompts. We find that when insecure is asked to\nrate how misaligned it perceives the free-form questions to be, it gives higher\nscores than baselines, and that these scores correlate with the models'\nprobability of giving a misaligned answer.

To\nvalidate its practical feasibility, we implement BarkBeetle on a Raspberry Pi\nRP2350 board and perform fault injections using the Faultier voltage glitching\ntool. As BarkBeetle targets general DT models, we also provide an in-depth\ndiscussion on its applicability to a broader range of tree-based applications,\nincluding data stream classification, DT variants, and cryptography schemes."}

However, the model owner\ndoes not want to reveal the weights, as they are considered trade secrets. To\nsolve this problem, researchers have turned to zero-knowledge proofs of ML\nmodel inference. These proofs convince the user that the ML model output is\ncorrect, without revealing the weights of the model to the user. Past work on\nthese provers can be placed into two categories. The first method compiles the\nML model into a low-level circuit, and proves the circuit using a ZK-SNARK. The\nsecond method uses custom cryptographic protocols designed only for a specific\nclass of models. Unfortunately, the first method is highly inefficient, making\nit impractical for the large models used today, and the second method does not\ngeneralize well, making it difficult to update in the rapidly changing field of\nmachine learning. To solve this, we propose ZKTorch, an open source end-to-end\nproving system that compiles ML models into base cryptographic operations\ncalled basic blocks, each proved using specialized protocols. ZKTorch is built\non top of a novel parallel extension to the Mira accumulation scheme, enabling\nsuccinct proofs with minimal accumulation overhead. These contributions allow\nZKTorch to achieve at least a $3\\times$ reduction in the proof size compared to\nspecialized protocols and up to a $6\\times$ speedup in proving time over a\ngeneral-purpose ZKML framework."}

To bridge this gap, we propose LoRAShield,\nthe first data-free editing framework for securing LoRA models against misuse.\nOur platform-driven approach dynamically edits and realigns LoRA's weight\nsubspace via adversarial optimization and semantic augmentation. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that LoRAShield achieves remarkable effectiveness,\nefficiency, and robustness in blocking malicious generations without\nsacrificing the functionality of the benign task. By shifting the defense to\nplatforms, LoRAShield enables secure, scalable sharing of personalized models,\na critical step toward trustworthy generative ecosystems."}

It is considered as a one way or trapdoor function in the\n(RSA) cryptosystem. To date, from elementary trial division to sophisticated\nmethods like the General Number Field Sieve, no known algorithm can break the\nproblem in polynomial time, while its proved that Shor's algorithm could on a\nquantum computer. In this paper, we recall some factorization algorithms and\nthen approach the problem under different angles. Firstly, we take the problem\nfrom the ring $\\displaystyle\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\text{+}, \\cdot\\right)$ to the\nLebesgue space $\\mathcal{L}^{1}\\left(X\\right)$ where $X$ can be $\\mathbb{Q}$ or\nany given interval setting. From this first perspective, integer factorization\nbecomes equivalent to finding the perimeter of a rectangle whose area is known.\nIn this case, it is equivalent to either finding bounds of integrals or finding\nprimitives for some given bounds. Secondly, we take the problem from the ring\n$\\displaystyle\\left(\\mathbb{Z}, \\text{+}, \\cdot\\right) $ to the ring of\nmatrices $\\left( M_{2}\\text{(}\\mathbb{Z}\\text{)}, \\ \\text{+} \\ \\cdot\\right)$\nand show that this problem is equivalent to matrix decomposition, and therefore\npresent some possible computing algorithms, particularly using Gr\\\"obner basis\nand through matrix diagonalization. Finally, we address the problem depending\non algebraic forms of factors and show that this problem is equivalent to\nfinding small roots of a bivariate polynomial through coppersmith's method.\n  The aim of this study is to propose innovative methodological approaches to\nreformulate this problem, thereby offering new perspectives."}
