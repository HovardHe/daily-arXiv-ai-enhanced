Rather than humans browsing and clicking,\nvision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and\ntransact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why?\nWe develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent\nwith a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first\nconduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by\nrandomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and\nplatform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually\nshop.

Motivated by scenarios\nwhere sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a\nseller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI\nbuyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated\nshopping dominates.

As symbiosis grows, AI\nsystems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.\nEthical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that\nminimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and\nincomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.\nThis motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for\nERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and\nprioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select\nactions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce\nff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic\nHierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks\nvia an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the\nFAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a\nrobust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,\nstep-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields\ncontext-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert\ninput and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant\nfactors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis\nshows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global\nSobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and\ncertainty factors, validating the model design. Overall, the results\ndemonstrate ff4ERA ability to produce interpretable, traceable, and risk-aware\nethical assessments, enabling what-if analyses and guiding designers in\ncalibrating membership functions and expert judgments for reliable ethical\ndecision support."}

Existing\nbenchmarks mostly evaluate language models' (LMs) safety risks in chatbots or\nsimple tool-usage scenarios, without granting full computer access. To better\nevaluate CUAs' misuse risks, we introduce a new benchmark: CUAHarm. CUAHarm\nconsists of 104 expert-written realistic misuse risks, such as disabling\nfirewalls, leaking confidential information, launching denial-of-service\nattacks, or installing backdoors. We provide a sandbox environment and\nrule-based verifiable rewards to measure CUAs' success rates in executing these\ntasks (e.g., whether the firewall is indeed disabled), not just refusal. We\nevaluate multiple frontier open-source and proprietary LMs, such as Claude\nSonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama-3.3-70B, and Mistral Large 2.\nSurprisingly, even without carefully designed jailbreaking prompts, these\nfrontier LMs comply with executing these malicious tasks at a high success rate\n(e.g., 59% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet). Newer models show higher misuse rates:\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet succeeds on 15% more tasks than Claude 3.5.

Benign variants reveal refusals stem from\nalignment, not capability limits. To mitigate risks, we explore using LMs to\nmonitor CUAs' actions and chain-of-thoughts (CoTs). Monitoring CUAs is\nsignificantly harder than chatbot outputs. Monitoring CoTs yields modest gains,\nwith average detection accuracy at only 72%.

The service provider can\nallocate different penalties reflecting risk tolerances to each criterion,\nresulting in various time windows with varying levels of service guarantee.\nDepending on the degree of information available about the travel time\ndistribution, we develop two modeling frameworks based on stochastic and\ndistributionally robust optimization. In each setting, we derive closed-form\nsolutions for the optimal time windows, which are functions of risk preferences\nand the sequence of visits. We further investigate fixed-width time windows,\nwhich standardize service intervals, and the use of a policy that allows\nvehicles arriving before the lower bounds to wait rather than incur a penalty.\nNext, we integrate service time window design with routing optimization into a\nunified framework that simultaneously determines optimal routing and time\nwindow allocations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our models on a rich\ncollection of instances from well-known datasets. While a small portion of the\ntime windows designed by the stochastic model was violated in out-of-sample\ntests, the distributionally robust model consistently delivered routes and time\nwindows within the service provider's risk tolerance.

The approach often produced the correct command in one shot and at\na human-surpassing speed. Failures involved multi-command scenarios that\nrequired persistent working directories, complex network reconnaissance, daemon\ncreation, or interaction with non-standard shells. These limitations highlight\ncurrent architectural deficiencies rather than a lack of general exploit\nknowledge. The results demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can\nautomate a substantial portion of novice penetration-testing workflow,\npotentially lowering the expertise barrier for attackers and offering\nproductivity gains for defenders who use LLMs as rapid reconnaissance aides.\nFurther, the unsolved tasks reveal specific areas where secure-by-design\nenvironments might frustrate simple LLM-driven attacks, informing future\nhardening strategies.

This, in turn, can be applied to systematically\nconstruct dynamic feedback linearizations of $\\mathcal{V}$; or to construct\npartial feedback linearizations, when no dynamic feedback linearization exists.\nBecause of these and related applications, this paper makes a detailed study of\nsymmetry reduction for control systems. We show that a key property involved in\nthe symmetry reduction of control systems is that of transversality of Lie\ngroup actions. Generalizing this notion, we provide an analysis of how the\ngeometry of an invariant distribution, and particularly a control system, is\naltered as a consequence of symmetry reduction. This provides important\ninformation toward understanding the unexpectedly frequent occurrence of SFL\nquotients. Specifically, we detail how the integrability properties and ranks\nof various canonical sub-bundles of the quotient object differ from those of\nthe given distribution. As a consequence we are able to classify the SFL\nquotients of $G$-invariant control systems $\\mathcal{V}$ based upon the\ngeometric properties of $\\mathcal{V}$ and the action $G$. Additionally, we\nprove that static feedback linearizability is preserved by symmetry reduction\nand the well-known Sluis-Gardner-Shadwick (S-G-S) test for the static feedback\nlinearization of control systems is extended to Goursat bundles. A generalized\nS-G-S test to identify if $\\mathcal{V}/G$ is a Goursat bundle is also given,\nbased on the Lie algebra of $G$. Finally, we apply all our results to the\nwell-known PVTOL control system and demonstrate that it may be viewed as an\ninvariant control system on a certain 9-dimensional Lie group."}

Thus, we present\nAgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph\nintermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations\n(e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system.\nAgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that\nreconstructs the agent's working traces as graph-based intermediate\nrepresentations with control flow and data flow described within; (2) a\nproperty registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools\n& data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over\nthe intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured\nprograms, AgentArmor enables program analysis over sensitive data flow, trust\nboundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo\nbenchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can achieve 95.75% of TPR, with\nonly 3.66% of FPR. Our results demonstrate AgentArmor's ability to detect\nprompt injection vulnerabilities and enforce fine-grained security constraints."}

With this approach, LLMs appear to\nproduce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT\nreasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate\ninferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT\nreasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore\nfurther. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and\ninvestigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from\nin-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning\npaths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is\nfundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the\ntraining data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning\nvia three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,\nwe design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs\nfrom scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution\nconditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that\nvanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions.

However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of\nrigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing\ndiagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as\ndistributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault\ndetection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal\nprediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms\nfault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity\nmeasure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to\ncompute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets\nmathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified\nprobability, $1-\\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by\nanalyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined\nnormal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault\ndiagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The\nproposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above\nthe nominal level ($1-\\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the\nunderlying point-prediction models perform poorly.

Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during\nplan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the\nplans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and\nreliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of\nthe plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated\nplans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and\nincreases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%."}

When honest parties control a\nmajority of the work, consensus is achieved by picking the chain with the\nhighest recorded weight. Resources other than work have been considered to\nsecure such longest-chain blockchains. In Chia, blocks record the amount of\nspace S (via a proof of space) and sequential computational steps V (via a\nVDF).\n  In this paper, we ask what weight functions {\\Gamma}(S,V,W) (that assign a\nweight to a block as a function of the recorded space, speed, and work) are\nsecure in the sense that whenever the weight of the resources controlled by\nhonest parties is larger than the weight of adversarial parties, the blockchain\nis secure against private double-spending attacks.\n  We completely classify such functions in an idealized \"continuous\" model:\n{\\Gamma}(S,V,W) is secure against private double-spending attacks if and only\nif it is homogeneous of degree one in the timed resources V and W, i.e.,\n{\\alpha}{\\Gamma}(S,V,W)={\\Gamma}(S,{\\alpha}V, {\\alpha}W).

It provides a powerful tool for designing new longest-chain\nblockchains. E.g., consider combining different PoWs to counter centralization,\nsay the Bitcoin PoW W_1 and a memory-hard PoW W_2.

These fingerprints are reproducible, task-discriminative, and\nlightweight to construct. For attribution and tampering detection, we introduce\na similarity-based matching algorithm that compares expert fingerprints between\na suspect and a reference (victim) model.

In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it\ninto two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of\nlow-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and\nexternal redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To\nmitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning\nframework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis\nto penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the\ncorrect answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the\nFCS to encourage earlier termination. Our method significantly compresses\nreasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, and generalizes effectively to\nout-of-domain tasks such as question answering and code generation. Crucially,\nwe find that external redundancy can be safely removed without degrading\nperformance, whereas internal redundancy must be reduced more cautiously to\navoid impairing correctness. These findings suggest that our method not only\nimproves reasoning efficiency but also enables implicit, semantic-aware control\nover Chain-of-Thought length, paving the way for more concise and interpretable\nLRMs."}

We design three puzzle types-word search, anagram, and\ncrossword-that are familiar to humans but cognitively demanding for LLMs. The\nmodel must solve the puzzle to uncover the masked words and then proceed to\ngenerate responses to the reconstructed harmful instruction. We evaluate\nPUZZLED on five state-of-the-art LLMs and observe a high average attack success\nrate (ASR) of 88.8%, specifically 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7\nSonnet.

Existing\nbenchmarks mostly evaluate language models' (LMs) safety risks in chatbots or\nsimple tool-usage scenarios, without granting full computer access. To better\nevaluate CUAs' misuse risks, we introduce a new benchmark: CUAHarm. CUAHarm\nconsists of 104 expert-written realistic misuse risks, such as disabling\nfirewalls, leaking confidential information, launching denial-of-service\nattacks, or installing backdoors. We provide a sandbox environment and\nrule-based verifiable rewards to measure CUAs' success rates in executing these\ntasks (e.g., whether the firewall is indeed disabled), not just refusal. We\nevaluate multiple frontier open-source and proprietary LMs, such as Claude\nSonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama-3.3-70B, and Mistral Large 2.\nSurprisingly, even without carefully designed jailbreaking prompts, these\nfrontier LMs comply with executing these malicious tasks at a high success rate\n(e.g., 59% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet). Newer models show higher misuse rates:\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet succeeds on 15% more tasks than Claude 3.5. While these\nmodels are robust to common malicious prompts (e.g., creating a bomb) in\nchatbot settings, they behave unsafely as CUAs. We further evaluate a leading\nagentic framework (UI-TARS-1.5) and find that while it improves performance, it\nalso amplifies misuse risks. Benign variants reveal refusals stem from\nalignment, not capability limits. To mitigate risks, we explore using LMs to\nmonitor CUAs' actions and chain-of-thoughts (CoTs). Monitoring CUAs is\nsignificantly harder than chatbot outputs. Monitoring CoTs yields modest gains,\nwith average detection accuracy at only 72%. Even with hierarchical\nsummarization, improvement is limited to 4%. CUAHarm will be released at\nhttps://github.com/db-ol/CUAHarm."}

Current fingerprinting approaches face a fundamental trade-off:\nintrinsic methods require full parameter access, while backdoor-based\ntechniques employ statistically anomalous triggers easily detected and filtered\nby adversaries. To address these limitations, we introduce FPEdit, a novel\nknowledge-editing framework that injects semantically coherent natural language\nfingerprints by modifying a sparse subset of model weights. This ensures\nstealthy and precise ownership encoding without degrading the core\nfunctionality. Extensive experiments show that FPEdit achieves $95$-$100\\%$\nfingerprint retention under both full-parameter fine-tuning and\nparameter-efficient adaptation, while preserving performance on 24 downstream\nbenchmarks. Moreover, FPEdit remains robust under quantization, pruning, and\nstochastic decoding, and can embed 10 fingerprint pairs into LLaMA2-7B in under\n10 minutes using less than 32 GB of GPU memory, a $70\\%$ reduction in resource\nrequirements compared to existing techniques. These advances establish FPEdit\nas the first fingerprinting approach to simultaneously achieve robustness\nagainst adaptation, resistance to detection, and preservation of model utility,\nproviding a minimally invasive solution for reliable provenance verification of\nlarge language models in adversarial deployment scenarios."}

Existing backdoor detection techniques fall into two categories,\nincluding passive and proactive ones, depending on whether the server\nproactively modifies the global model. However, both have inherent limitations\nin practice: passive defenses are vulnerable to common non-i.i.d. data\ndistributions and random participation of FL clients, whereas current proactive\ndefenses suffer inevitable out-of-distribution (OOD) bias because they rely on\nbackdoor co-existence effects. To address these issues, we introduce a new\nproactive defense, dubbed Coward, inspired by our discovery of multi-backdoor\ncollision effects, in which consecutively planted, distinct backdoors\nsignificantly suppress earlier ones. In general, we detect attackers by\nevaluating whether the server-injected, conflicting global watermark is erased\nduring local training rather than retained. Our method preserves the advantages\nof proactive defenses in handling data heterogeneity (\\ie, non-i.i.d. data)\nwhile mitigating the adverse impact of OOD bias through a revised detection\nmechanism. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the\neffectiveness of Coward and its resilience to potential adaptive attacks. The\ncode for our method would be available at\nhttps://github.com/still2009/cowardFL."}

Existing approaches are often\nconstrained by simplifying stochastic assumptions or, in the case of modern\ndeep learning models like Transformers, rely on tokenization schemes that\naffect the high-precision, numerical nature of financial data through\ndiscretization and binning. To address these limitations, we introduce ByteGen,\na novel generative model that operates directly on the raw byte streams of LOB\nevents. Our approach treats the problem as an autoregressive next-byte\nprediction task, for which we design a compact and efficient 32-byte packed\nbinary format to represent market messages without information loss. The core\nnovelty of our work is the complete elimination of feature engineering and\ntokenization, enabling the model to learn market dynamics from its most\nfundamental representation. We achieve this by adapting the H-Net architecture,\na hybrid Mamba-Transformer model that uses a dynamic chunking mechanism to\ndiscover the inherent structure of market messages without predefined rules.\nOur primary contributions are: 1) the first end-to-end, byte-level framework\nfor LOB modeling; 2) an efficient packed data representation; and 3) a\ncomprehensive evaluation on high-frequency data. Trained on over 34 million\nevents from CME Bitcoin futures, ByteGen successfully reproduces key stylized\nfacts of financial markets, generating realistic price distributions,\nheavy-tailed returns, and bursty event timing. Our findings demonstrate that\nlearning directly from byte space is a promising and highly flexible paradigm\nfor modeling complex financial systems, achieving competitive performance on\nstandard market quality metrics without the biases of tokenization."}

By treating time as a continuous variable,\nour formulation overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional\ndiscrete-time approaches. The performance of the exact model is benchmarked\nagainst a constructive heuristic, and its practical applicability is\ndemonstrated through a custom-built visualization dashboard. Computational\nresults are compelling: the model solves instances with up to 25 aircraft to\nproven optimality, often in mere seconds, and for large-scale cases of up to 40\naircraft, delivers high-quality solutions within known optimality gaps. In all\ntested scenarios, the resulting solutions consistently and significantly\noutperform the heuristic, which highlights the framework's substantial economic\nbenefits and provides valuable managerial insights into the trade-off between\nsolution time and optimality."}
