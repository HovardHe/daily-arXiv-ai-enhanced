However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs\ndespite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,\nconditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate\ntrajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in\naccuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of\nheterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,\na diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting\na new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%."}

This\nregrettable omission is in spite of the fact that many functions in modern day\napplications of optimization can be shown to be quasi-differentiable. In\nessence, a quasi-differentiable function is one whose directional derivative at\nan arbitrary reference vector, as a function of the direction, is the\ndifference of two positively homogenous, convex functions. Thus, to bring\nquasi-differentiable functions closer to the class of difference-of-convex\nfunctions that has received fast growing attention in recent years in\nconnection with many applied subjects, we propose to rename\nquasi-differentiable functions as quasi-difference-convex (quasi-dc) functions.\nBesides modernizing and advancing this class of nonconvex and nondifferentiable\nfunctions, our research aims to put together a unified treatment of iterative\nconvex-programming based descent algorithms for solving a broad class of\ncomposite quasi-dc programs and to establish their subsequential convergence,\nsequential convergence, and rates of convergence; the latter two topics are in\nline with the modern focus of such analysis for convex programs and some\nextensions and are departures from the sole emphasis of subsequential\nconvergence in the traditional studies of quasi-differentiable optimization.\nThrough this research, we have gained significant new insights and\nunderstanding, advanced the fundamentals, and broadened the applications of\nthis neglected yet pervasive class of nonconvex and nondifferentiable functions\nand their optimization."}

A key privacy issue in FRS is protecting the user's\nface template, as the characteristics of the user's face image can be recovered\nfrom the template. Although recent advances in cryptographic tools such as\nhomomorphic encryption (HE) have provided opportunities for securing the FRS,\nHE cannot be used directly with FRS in an efficient plug-and-play manner. In\nparticular, although HE is functionally complete for arbitrary programs, it is\nbasically designed for algebraic operations on encrypted data of predetermined\nshape, such as a polynomial ring. Thus, a non-tailored combination of HE and\nthe system can yield very inefficient performance, and many previous HE-based\nface template protection methods are hundreds of times slower than plain\nsystems without protection. In this study, we propose IDFace, a new HE-based\nsecure and efficient face identification method with template protection.\nIDFace is designed on the basis of two novel techniques for efficient searching\non a (homomorphically encrypted) biometric database with an angular metric.

This work presents two primary contributions:\nFirst, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,\neffectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease\nthe search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game\ntopology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a\ntopology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual\ninformation. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV\npenetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL.
