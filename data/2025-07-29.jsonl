A Product-Congruence Game tracks play via the\nmodular or finite-field product of heap values, providing a single invariant\nthat unifies the algebraic cores of these two ubiquitous symmetric and\nasymmetric cryptosystems.

For poly-MuM we prove\nthe single-hole property inside its threshold region, implying that the\nSprague-Grundy values are multiplicative under disjunctive sums in that region.\nBeyond these instances, we establish four structural theorems for a general\nProduct-Congruence Game PCG($m,R$): (i) single-heap repair above the modulus,\n(ii) ultimate period $m$ per coordinate, (iii) exact and asymptotic losing\ndensities, and (iv) confinement of optimal play to a finite indeterminacy\nregion. An operation-alignment collapse principle explains why some variants\ndegenerate to a single aggregate while MuM, $\\phi$-MuM and poly-MuM retain rich\nlocal structure.

Therefore, we first formalize the notion of\nrecovery metadata in the context of social key recovery, illustrating the\ntradeoff between easing the burden of memorizing the metadata and maintaining\nmetadata privacy. We present Apollo, the first framework that addresses this\ntradeoff by distributing indistinguishable data within a user's social circle,\nwhere trustees hold relevant data and non-trustees store random data. Apollo\neliminates the need to memorize recovery metadata since a user eventually\ngathers sufficient data from her social circle for recovery.

To make the anonymity set\nscalable, Apollo proposes a novel multi-layered secret sharing scheme that\nmitigates the overhead due to the random data distributed among non-trustees.\nFinally, we provide a prototype implementation of Apollo and report on its\nperformance. Apollo reduces the chances of malicious recovery to between 0.005%\nand 1.8%, depending on the adversary's ability to compromise.

This Stackelberg stopping game can be viewed as an optimal control\nproblem for the leader. Our primary focus is on the time-inconsistency that\narises from the leader-follower game structure. We begin by using a\nfinite-horizon example to clarify key concepts, including precommitment and\nequilibrium strategies in the Stackelberg setting, as well as the Nash\nequilibrium in the standard Dynkin game. We then turn to the infinite-horizon\ncase and study randomized precommitment and equilibrium strategies.

In this paper, building upon the fully first-order\npenalty-based approach, we propose an efficient value function-free (PBGD-Free)\nalgorithm that eliminates the loop of solving the lower-level problem and\nadmits fully single-loop updates. Inspired by the landscape analysis of\nrepresentation learning-based LLM fine-tuning problem, we propose a relaxed\nflatness condition for the upper-level function and prove the convergence of\nthe proposed value-function-free algorithm. We test the performance of the\nproposed algorithm in various applications and demonstrate its superior\ncomputational efficiency over the state-of-the-art bilevel methods."}

However, grid-connected\nelectrolyzers may inadvertently increase power-system emissions, resulting in\nhydrogen whose life-cycle intensity is similar to or higher than that of gray\nhydrogen. To address the high cost barrier of electrolytic hydrogen, both the\nE.U. and U.S. have introduced subsidy schemes conditional on low associated\nemissions. One key requirement is temporal matching, under which a subsidy\napplies only to the hydrogen volume that, ex-post, can be shown to match\nrenewable generation over each one-hour interval. This requirement exposes the\nelectrolyzer to uncertainty in the subsidy-eligible volume and thus the value\nof the produced hydrogen. This paper develops an uncertainty-aware day-ahead\nbid curve for a grid-connected electrolyzer. We formulate a linear program that\nmaximizes expected profit across scenarios of renewable production and derive\nthe bid curve from its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. A case study demonstrates\nthat incorporating renewable uncertainty into the bid curve increases\nelectrolyzer profit by approximately 4%, although it does not improve ex-post\ntemporal matching. This finding highlights a potential distortion in the\nincentive effects of temporal-matching regulations when uncertainty is taken\ninto account."}

In this work, we propose an optimal transport\nframework that includes dynamic constraints specified by the fundamental\ndiagram for modeling macroscopic traffic flow. The problem is cast as a convex\nvariant of dynamic optimal transport, with additional nonlinear\ntemporal-spatial inequality constraints of momentum, modeled after the\nfundamental diagram from traffic theory. This constraint imposes a\ndensity-dependent upper bound on the admissible flux, capturing flow saturation\nand congestion effects, and thus leaves space for kinetic optimization. The\nformulation follows the Benamou-Brenier transportation rationale, whereby\nkinetic energy over density and momentum fields is optimized subject to the\nmass conservation law.

To address this issue, in this paper, through the adaptive\nfuzzified construction of temporal data, we propose a novel convolutional\narchitecture with partially asymmetric design based on the scheme of sliding\nwindow to realize accurate time series forecasting. First, the construction\nstrategy of traditional fuzzy time series is improved to further extract short\nand long term temporal interrelation, which enables every time node to\nautomatically possess corresponding global information and inner relationships\namong them in a restricted sliding window and the process does not require\nhuman involvement. Second, a bilateral Atrous algorithm is devised to reduce\ncalculation demand of the proposed model without sacrificing global\ncharacteristics of elements. And it also allows the model to avoid processing\nredundant information. Third, after the transformation of time series, a\npartially asymmetric convolutional architecture is designed to more flexibly\nmine data features by filters in different directions on feature maps, which\ngives the convolutional neural network (CNN) the ability to construct\nsub-windows within existing sliding windows to model at a more fine-grained\nlevel. And after obtaining the time series information at different levels, the\nmulti-scale features from different sub-windows will be sent to the\ncorresponding network layer for time series information fusion. Compared with\nother competitive modern models, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nresults on most of popular time series datasets, which is fully verified by the\nexperimental results."}
