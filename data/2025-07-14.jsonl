One important feature of the\nworst-case DP guarantee is it naturally implies protections against adversaries\nwith less prior information, more sophisticated attack goals, and complex\nmeasures of a successful attack. However, the analytical tradeoffs between the\nadversarial model and the privacy protections conferred by DP are not well\nunderstood thus far. To that end, this work sheds light on what the worst-case\nguarantee of DP implies about the success of attackers that are more\nrepresentative of real-world privacy risks.\n  In this paper, we present a single flexible framework that generalizes and\nextends the patchwork of bounds on DP mechanisms found in prior work. Our\nframework allows us to compute high-probability guarantees for DP mechanisms on\na large family of natural attack settings that previous bounds do not capture.\nOne class of such settings is the approximate reconstruction of multiple\nindividuals' data, such as inferring nearly entire columns of a tabular data\nset from noisy marginals and extracting sensitive information from DP-trained\nlanguage models.\n  We conduct two empirical case studies to illustrate the versatility of our\nbounds and compare them to the success of state-of-the-art attacks.\nSpecifically, we study attacks that extract non-uniform PII from a DP-trained\nlanguage model, as well as multi-column reconstruction attacks where the\nadversary has access to some columns in the clear and attempts to reconstruct\nthe remaining columns for each person's record. We find that the absolute\nprivacy risk of attacking non-uniform data is highly dependent on the\nadversary's prior probability of success.

While extensively studied on\nIntel and AMD CPUs with DDR and LPDDR memories, its impact on GPUs using GDDR\nmemories, critical for emerging machine learning applications, remains\nunexplored. Rowhammer attacks on GPUs face unique challenges: (1) proprietary\nmapping of physical memory to GDDR banks and rows, (2) high memory latency and\nfaster refresh rates that hinder effective hammering, and (3) proprietary\nmitigations in GDDR memories, difficult to reverse-engineer without FPGA-based\ntest platforms. We introduce GPUHammer, the first Rowhammer attack on NVIDIA\nGPUs with GDDR6 DRAM. GPUHammer proposes novel techniques to reverse-engineer\nGDDR DRAM row mappings, and employs GPU-specific memory access optimizations to\namplify hammering intensity and bypass mitigations. Thus, we demonstrate the\nfirst successful Rowhammer attack on a discrete GPU, injecting up to 8\nbit-flips across 4 DRAM banks on an NVIDIA A6000 with GDDR6 memory.

In\npractice, this yields only few LPC-kernels for which this condition is proved.\nAt the heart of our contribution lies the kernel switch, which uncouples the\nmodel kernel from the LPC assumption: it enables to leverage any known\nLPC-kernel as a pivot kernel to prove error bounds, provided embedding\nconditions are verified between the model and pivot RKHS.

Accurate state estimation in these\nsystems is complicated by limited and heterogeneous measurement\ninfrastructures, where real-time data from supervisory control and data\nacquisition (SCADA) and micro-phasor measurement units ($\\mu$-PMUs) is sparse,\nand slower data from Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is abundant but\ndelayed. In this context, historical data becomes a key asset, yet its\neffective use requires robust methods that account for its relevance and\nvariability. This paper proposes a novel data-driven methodology for state\nestimation under limited real-time observability. We first introduce a\nnon-parametric estimator that leverages nearest neighbors to approximate the\nconditional expectation of delayed measurement residuals. Building on this, we\ndevelop a robustified extension that accounts for ambiguity in the estimated\nconditional distribution, mitigating the impact of sample sparsity and\nuncertainty.

Usually, AI Agents utilize\nsophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a\npromising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought\nand Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent\nlimitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative\nreasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end,\nwe propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought\n(INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute\nprogrammatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt.\nTherefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM,\nwhich can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six\nbenchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified,\nwith an average improvement of 7.95\\% in performance, exceeding the baselines.\nFurthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best\nperforming method at baseline by 58.3\\%. In addition, we demonstrate the\nversatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification\nexperiments."}
